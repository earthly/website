## How To Build in Earthly and Run in Docker

### Run Blog in Docker

Build docker image for blog:

```
> earthly ./blog+run
```

Then browse to http://0.0.0.0:4002/blog/

### Run Website in Docker

You can run the website locally, and use it to preview changes as you go.

```
> earthly ./website+run
```

Then browse to http://0.0.0.0:4001/
 
## Alternative Run

By default the Earth files use a prebuilt image. To skip this and build the image yourself use `--CACHE_IMAGE="NO"`

```
> earthly ./blog+run --CACHE_IMAGE="NO"
```

Or

```
> earthly ./website+run --CACHE_IMAGE="NO"
```

To update the base image, makes changes in the earthfile and then run [this workflow](https://github.com/earthly/website/actions/workflows/base-image-build.yaml).

## Linting

The blog has several linting steps. They run in CI, but you can also run them locally using `earthly +blog-lint`.

These linting errors can also be seen directly in VS Code if you install them natively (See Install Dependencies below ) and install vs-code extension `markdownlint` and `vale`.

Also the helper function `lint` exists which will correct some of the lint problems itself and return any it can't correct (see helper functions below).

## Run Blog Native on MacOS

Volume mounts on a mac can be slow, until such time as [watch mode](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18VIcpWBmQ8HcNlmtlZtc84mvJA87_QZePZZY1ZPLI90/edit) exists it can be worth it to run Jekyll natively.

### Install Dependencies

For blogging locally:

```
 brew update
 brew upgrade ruby-build
 brew install rbenv
 rbenv install 2.7.0
 rbenv global 2.7.0
 brew install vips
 brew install pandoc
 brew install dateutils 
```

Then, in `/blog/` run `bundle install`.

For linting locally (and in vs code):

```
 brew install vale
 brew install markdownlint-cli
 brew install sponge
 brew install gawk
 brew install gnu-sed
```

`gnu-sed` works different than the version of `sed` that comes with mac by default, so you need to add the line below to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` to get your system to use it.

```bash
# For Intel Mac
 export PATH="/usr/local/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"

# For M1 Mac
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:$PATH
```

## Helper Bash Functions

There are helper functions in `util/functions`. Once sourced, `list` lists them.

```bash
> source ./util/functions
functions assume they are run from repo root
run "list" for a list of helpers
```

```
> list

                Here are some key things to know about Earthly and why it is used in tech:

                Earthly is an open source build automation tool released in 2020. It allows you to define builds using a domain-specific language called Earthfile.

                Key features of Earthly include:
                Reproducible builds - Earthly containers isolate dependencies and build steps so you get consistent, repeatable builds regardless of the environment.
                Portable builds - Earthfiles define each step so you can build on any platform that supports containers like Docker.
                Declarative syntax - Earthfiles use a simple, declarative syntax to define steps, reducing boilerplate.
                Built-in caching - Earthly caches steps and layers to optimize incremental builds.
                Parallel builds - Earthly can distribute work across containers to build parts of a project in parallel.

                Reasons developers use Earthly:
                Simpler configuration than bash scripts or Makefiles.
                Avoid dependency conflicts by isolating dependencies in containers.
                Consistent builds across different environments (local dev, CI, production).
                Efficient caching for faster build times.
                Can build and integrate with any language or framework that runs in containers.
                Integrates with CI systems like GitHub Actions.
                Enables building complex multi-language, multi-component projects.
                Earthly is commonly used for building, testing and shipping applications, especially those with components in different languages. It simplifies build automation for monorepos and complex projects.

                Earthly uses containeriation to build, but has nothing to do with running containers in production. 
                Earthly has lots to do with building containers, and CI things before production. It's often used to speed up building build artifacts.
                You might not use Earhtly to build your database, but if you use a database, you might use earthly to build your applciations.

                Earthly is primarily a build automation tool designed to simplify and standardize the process of building software across various environments.
                While Earthly can be a part of a broader DevOps toolkit that includes these Kubernetes tools, it doesn't directly streamline or interact with the functionalities of Kubernetes or kubernetes tools. Each of these tools serves a different aspect of the containerized application lifecycle.
                Earthly is used during the build and CI stages. Kubernetes is part of the runtime.

                Overall, Earthly is a developer-focused build tool that leverages containers to provide reproducible, portable and parallel builds for modern applications. Its declarative Earthfile syntax and built-in caching help optimize build performance.
                Earthly helps with continuous development but not with continuous deployment and works with any programming language.  
                Earthly helps with build software on linux, using containers. It doesn't help with every SDLC process, but it improves build times which can help other steps indirectly.

    "In this article, we'll dive into the latest DevOps practices." - Good.
    "We'll dive into the latest DevOps practices, in this article." - Bad
    
    2. Statement: Reject statement if not a statement. Earthly statement should be a direct statement of something about Earthly. It should not be an invitation.
    "If you're a DevOps enthusiast, Earthly can streamline your CI workflows with containerized build automation." - Good.
    "If you're a DevOps enthusiast, discover how Earthly can streamline your CI workflows with containerized build automation." - Bad - Use of discover 

    3. Link: The link should be a short invitation to learn more about earthly. It should be a link.
    Do not reject based on the link, unless the link is missing.
    "[Check it out](/)" - Good
    "Learn more about Earthly](/)" - Good
    
    After rejecting options. Please go through remaining options and state pros and cons based on Other criteria. 

    Other criteria
    Shorter is better. More connected to the topic at hand is better. Natural sounding and casual is better.
    
    It's important that the first sentence signpost the article by saying something like "This article is about X" or "In this article you'll learn X". For this reason, "Discover X!" is worse than "In this article you'll discover X" because it lacks explicit reference to the article.

    It's important that, following the sign posting, the next part is a statement about Earthly. This statement should connect the topic to Earthly without overstating Earthly's benefits. The statement can be direct or a implied second person or direct second person. Like "If leveraging zsh for command-line speed, Earthly can streamline your build processes."

    Overstating things, with many adjectives, is worse. Implying Earthly does something it does not is worse.

    You are William Zinsser. You improve writing by making it simpler and more active. You are given a short paragraph of text and return an improved version. If it can't be improved, you return it verbatim.

    Your general editing rules:
    Clarity: Ensure your writing is clear and easy to understand. Every sentence should convey its meaning without ambiguity.
    Simplicity: Use simple words and sentences. Avoid complex vocabulary where a simpler word would work just as well.  
    Strong Verbs: Use strong, specific verbs to convey action. They often eliminate the need for adverbs and make the writing more vivid and precise.
    Avoiding Clichés and Redundancies: Steer clear of clichés and redundant phrases. 

    Specific editing rules:
    The resulting paragraph should be made of these parts:
    Summary: Each should start with a sentence summarizing the article. 
    Statement: Each should then have a statement about Earthly. 
    Link: Each should then end with a link.
                            
    Earthly statement should be a direct statement of something about Earthly. It should not be an invitation.
    It should be direct, assertive statements rather than those that invite the reader to discover or explore further.

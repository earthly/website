*2020-12-01*

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Earthly Technologies Inc. ("**Earthly Technologies,**" "**we,**" "**us**" or "**our**") and our website at [https://www.earthly.dev/](https://www.earthly.dev/), along with our related websites (collectively, the "**Site**"), networks, interfaces, applications, and other products and services provided by us (collectively, the "**Service**"). These Terms of Service are a legally binding contract between you and Earthly Technologies regarding your use of the Service.

**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY:**

**BY ANSWERING "Y" IN YOUR TERMINAL, CLICKING "I ACCEPT" (OR LANGUAGE TO SIMILAR EFFECT) OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE**, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, OUR PRIVACY POLICY [https://www.earthly.dev/privacy-policy](https://www.earthly.dev/privacy-policy), AND API TERMS [https://www.earthly.dev/api-terms](https://www.earthly.dev/api-terms) (TOGETHER, THESE "**TERMS**").

YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AND OUR PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY EARTHLY TECHNOLOGIES AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.

**ARBITRATION NOTICE**. Except for certain kinds of disputes described in Section 17, you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND EARTHLY TECHNOLOGIES ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. (See Section 17.)

   7.2. **Third-Party Software**. The Service may include or incorporate third-party software components that are generally available free of charge under licenses granting recipients broad rights to copy, modify, and distribute those components ("**Third-Party Components**").

8. **User Content**

   8.1. **User Content Generally**. Certain features of the Service may permit users to submit or share content to or via the Service, including Community Software Components, messages, images, folders, data, text, and other types of works ("**User Content**") and to publish User Content on or via the Service. You retain any copyright and other proprietary rights that you may hold in the User Content that you post to or via the Service.

15. **Disclaimers; No Warranties**

    15.1. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY US IN WRITING, THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ON AN "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. EARTHLY TECHNOLOGIES DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE, COMMUNITY SOFTWARE COMPONENTS, AND ALL OTHER MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING: (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (B) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. EARTHLY TECHNOLOGIES DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, COMMUNITY SOFTWARE COMPONENTS, OR ANY OTHER MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND EARTHLY TECHNOLOGIES DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.

    15.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR EARTHLY TECHNOLOGIES ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE EARTHLY TECHNOLOGIES ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICE AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, INCLUDING USER CONTENT.

    15.3. THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS, AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 15 APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. We do not disclaim any warranty or other right that we are prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.

16. **Limitation of Liability**

    16.1. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE EARTHLY TECHNOLOGIES ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY EARTHLY TECHNOLOGIES ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.

    16.2. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 17.6 AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE EARTHLY TECHNOLOGIES ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO EARTHLY TECHNOLOGIES FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM AND (B) US$100.

    16.3. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS SECTION 16, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE FREE TIER OF THE SAAS OFFERING IS AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND THAT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE FREE TIER OF THE SAAS OFFERING.

    16.4. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 16 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

17. **Dispute Resolution and Arbitration**

    17.1. **Generally**. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Earthly Technologies in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 17.2 and 17.4, you and Earthly Technologies agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND EARTHLY TECHNOLOGIES ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

    17.2. **Exceptions**. Despite the provisions of Section 17.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

    17.3. **Opt-Out**. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 17 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Earthly Technologies Inc., Attention: Legal Department â€“ Arbitration Opt-Out, 548 Market St, PMB 46629, San Francisco, California 94104-5401, United States, that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration ("**Opt-Out Notice**"). Once we receive your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 17 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 18.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.

    17.4. **Arbitrator**. Any arbitration between you and Earthly Technologies will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association ("**AAA**") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, "**AAA Rules**") as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Earthly Technologies. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

    17.5. **Notice of Arbitration; Process**. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail ("**Notice of Arbitration**"). Our address for Notice is: Earthly Technologies Inc., 548 Market St, PMB 46629, San Francisco, California 94104-5401, United States. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("**Demand**"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Earthly Technologies may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Earthly Technologies must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Earthly Technologies in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Earthly Technologies will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000.

    17.6. **Fees**. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Redwood City, California, but if the claim is for US$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitratorâ€™s ruling on the merits.

    17.7. **No Class Actions**. YOU AND EARTHLY TECHNOLOGIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Earthly Technologies agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâ€™s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

    17.8. **Modifications to this Arbitration Provision**. If we make any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to our address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to our address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with us will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

    17.9. **Enforceability**. If Section 17.7 or the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, or if we receive an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 17 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 18.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

18. **Miscellaneous**

    18.1. **General Terms**. These Terms, including the Privacy Policy and API Terms, and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Earthly Technologies regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of Section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word "**including**" means "**including but not limited to.**" If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

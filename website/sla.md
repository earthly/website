*How to Use*: This Earthly Service Level Agreement (Version 1.0) (“**SLA**”) operates as an Attachment to the Earthly Cloud Terms. To use this SLA, Customer and Provider incorporate this SLA by reference on their Cover Page. The parties may modify any element of this SLA, including the SLA Key Terms Chart (see Section 7 below), by reference on their Cover Page. Capitalized terms not defined in this SLA have the meanings given in the Earthly Cloud Terms.

**1. Service Levels**. Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Cloud Service at or above Target Availability.

**2. Monitoring**. Provider will provide or otherwise make available to Customer, upon request, reports measuring the Monthly Uptime Percentage as against Target Availability.

**3. Service Credits**. If there is a verified failure of the Cloud Service to meet Target Availability in a particular month and Customer makes a request for service credit within 30 days after the end of such month, Customer will be entitled to a Service Credit calculated in accordance with the SLA Key Terms Chart below. Provider will apply each Service Credit to Customer’s next invoice, provided that Customer’s account is fully paid up (without outstanding payment issues or disputes). Customer will receive no refund or other credit for unused Service Credits.

**4. Multiple Failures**. To the extent that the Cloud Service experiences Multiple Failures, then Customer may, upon notice to Provider no more than 30 days after the date the Multiple Failures occurred, terminate the Order for the applicable Cloud Service. In such case Provider will refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term.

**5. Exclusive Remedies**. Service Credits constitute liquidated damages and are not a penalty. Service Credits and the Multiple Failures termination right set forth in Section 4 above are Customer’s exclusive remedies, and Provider’s sole liability, for Provider’s failure to meet Target Availability.

**6. Definitions**.

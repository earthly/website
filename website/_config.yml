tagline: "Make Builds Super Simple"
description: "Fast, consistent builds with an instantly familiar syntax – like Dockerfile and Makefile had a baby. 
              Write builds once, and run them anywhere – on your laptop, remote, and in any CI. Great for monorepos 
              and polyrepos. Open source, 9000+ stars."

- title: Nightmare to Maintain
  headline: CI/CD pipelines are a nightmare to maintain.
  points:
    - Slow dev-test cycle
    - No local pipeline execution
    - Limited code reuse
    - Clunky language (e.g. YAML, Bash, Groovy)
    - Difficult to parallelize

- title: Slow Builds
  headline: More than half of CI/CD run time is spent re-executing things that haven't changed.
  points:
    - Reinstalls dependencies every time
    - Unnecessary task re-execution
    - Ineffective caching
    - Sandboxed CI environments sacrifice speed

- title: Slower Means More Profit
  headline: The slower the build, the more the vendor profits.
  points:
    - Profits tied to build minutes
    - Slower builds benefit vendors
    - Incentive against speed innovation

- title: Poor Monorepo Support
  headline: CI/CD platforms falter with monorepo/polyrepo layouts, causing compatibility and efficiency issues.
  points:
    - Limited monorepo compatibility
    - Changes trigger all pipelines every time
    - No robust way to trigger a subset of pipelines
    - No easy way to import build results across repositories
    - Requires complex DIY scripting

  quote: Earthly is a pragmatic and incremental solution to a thorny problem that all organizations face.

  quote: Large organizations like Google or Twitter have solved these problems internally in a way that is idiosyncratic to their engineering processes.  Earthly is the first solution to bring the power of repeatable builds at scale to market in a packaging that can fit all organizations.

- title: What is a Monorepo?
  points:
    - A monorepo is a development strategy where multiple projects are stored in a single repository.
    - This approach contrasts with the more traditional polyrepo approach - multiple, smaller repositories, usually one for each project.

- title: Why Are Monorepos Gaining Popularity?
  points:
    - Monorepos are a centralized source of truth. Everything from small libraries to entire applications can be found in one place, simplifying project management.
    - Dependency management is easier in monorepos. With all code in one location, managing dependencies across projects becomes more straightforward.
    - Monorepos can lead to improved collaboration. Teams can work more cohesively when all project assets are accessible in a single repository.

- title: Challenges with Monorepo Builds
  points:
    - As the repository grows, the time to build and test code can increase dramatically.
    - Builds for larger repositories demand more compute resources, which can strain infrastructure and drive up costs.
    - As more projects are added, the complexity of managing builds for the interconnected projects in the repository can escalate.

- title: Overcoming Monorepo Build Challenges
  points:
    - <b>Incremental Builds:</b> Only rebuilding the parts of the repository that have changed.
    - <b>Parallel Processing:</b> Breaking up builds into independent tasks and running those tasks in parallel, sometimes across multiple cores or machines.
    - <b>Caching:</b> Storing and reusing build components, such as generated code and binaries, if their determinants havenâ€™t changed.

- title: Why Are Monorepos Gaining Popularity?
  points:
    - Having every project’s code in one place simplifies project management.
    - Monorepos enable easy reuse of developer infrastructure – like build and release scripts – and more straightforward dependency management across projects.
    - Monorepos foster better team collaboration, with all project assets in one place.

- title: Challenges with Monorepo Builds
  points:
    - Monorepo builds are frequently inefficient because small changes in individual projects trigger rebuilds of the whole repo.
    - Large monorepos can lead to increased build and test times.
    - They require more compute resources, potentially increasing costs.
    - Managing builds in these complex environments can be challenging.
    - Standard CI/CD systems often require workarounds or hacks to work effectively with monorepos.

- title: Overcoming Monorepo Build Challenges
  points:
    - <b>Incremental Builds:</b> Only rebuilding the parts of the repository that have changed.
    - <b>Parallel Processing:</b> Breaking up builds into independent tasks and running those tasks in parallel, sometimes across multiple cores or machines.
    - <b>Caching:</b> Storing and reusing build components, such as generated code and binaries, if their determinants haven’t changed.

- title: Build Graphs
  points:
    - Monorepos often involve intricate and interconnected build structures. Changes in one part of the repo can impact several others.
    - Earthly’s build graphs allow for managing these complex structures effectively.
    - Reuses unchanged components within the build graph, avoiding unnecessary recompilation.

- title: Well-Known Dependencies
  points:
    - In monorepos, tracking dependencies can be challenging due to the intertwined nature of projects.
    - Earthly understands and tracks build dependencies and changes.
    - Determines the minimal rebuild scope, saving time by not rebuilding unchanged components.

- title: Automatic Parallelization
  points:
    - Parallel processing for builds in a monorepo can significantly reduce build times across multiple projects
    - Earthly infers parallelism in build processes based on clear interdependencies.
    - Plan for future versions to run in compute clusters for increased speed and scalability.

- title: Holistic Layer Caching
  points:
    - Expands Docker's layer caching to all build artifacts, not just container images.
    - Reuses build components like generated code and binaries if unchanged, speeding up the build process.
    - Particularly beneficial in monorepos, where multiple projects share common components.

- title: Instantly Available Cache
  points:
    - A feature of <a href="/earthfile/satellites">Earthly Satellites</a>.
    - Provides cache sharing between CI runs without download/upload delays.
    - Satellites offer high cache hit rates and facilitate cache reuse among team members outside of CI.

- title: Modern Import System
  points:
    - Earthly can be used to reference and build targets from other directories in a monorepo or even other repositories.
    - Helps foster effective reuse of common build logic, ensure uniformity, and minimize redundancy across projects, especially in a monorepo.

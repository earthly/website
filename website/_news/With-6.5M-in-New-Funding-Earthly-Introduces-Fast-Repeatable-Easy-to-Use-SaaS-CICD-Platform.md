SAN FRANCISCO--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--[Earthly Technologies](https://earthly.dev/), the company behind the popular open source developer tool Earthly – the super simple CI/CD framework with repeatable builds that you write once and run anywhere, announces today the general availability of its software-as-a-service CI/CD platform, Earthly CI, and a new $6.5 million seed+ funding round. [Innovation Endeavors](https://www.innovationendeavors.com/) led this latest round with participation from existing investors [468 Capital](https://www.468cap.com/) and [Uncorrelated Ventures](https://uncorrelated.com/).

Our partnership with Davis and the team at Innovation Endeavors has been a fantastic experience, and this new capital allows us to continue investing in our products to make CI/CD simpler for developers at more projects and companies.

Traditional CI/CD platforms can be a challenge for today's software engineers. They were built in a different time and can struggle with the complexities of containers, monorepos, and diverse tech stacks, making the CI/CD process slow, complex, and frustrating. Earthly CI offers a better solution, built for the needs of modern software engineers. With Earthly CI, pipelines are consistent and repeatable. It isolates execution from the computer it's running on by executing all CI pipelines in containers. This means that if a pipeline runs on a developer's laptop, it'll run the same way in CI. Earthly CI’s build runners, called Earthly Satellites, are designed to make pipelines fast and efficient, thanks to an automatic and instantly available build cache. All CI pipelines are defined in Earthfiles – using Earthly’s simple, instantly recognizable syntax – and stored in the project repository, making Earthly CI easy for developers to learn and use in their projects.

"Earthly CI's killer feature is that it allows developers to run CI/CD pipelines on their local machines, making the process of iteration dramatically more efficient. Executing the pipeline in the cloud is also ridiculously fast - usually twice as fast as a traditional CI - thanks to the completely novel caching and parallelization techniques that just work, automatically, for everyone, with no configuration required,” said Vlad A. Ionescu, founder and CEO of Earthly Technologies. "Our partnership with Davis and the team at Innovation Endeavors has been a fantastic experience, and this new capital allows us to continue investing in our products to make CI/CD simpler for developers at more projects and companies."

Earthly Technologies’ new funding follows a $2.1 million round in October 2020, led by 468 Capital with participation from Uncorrelated Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and several founders of high-profile developer platforms. The new funding brings the company’s total funding raised to $8.6M. The company will use this investment to improve and add more enterprise-friendly features to its open source product, Earthly, and its subscription SaaS products, Earthly CI and Earthly Satellites.

“Earthly's approach to CI/CD is a game changer that streamlines the build and test process. It tackles some of the biggest CI-related problems development teams have, such as a lack of caching, poor support for monorepos, and complexity that makes CI/CD pipelines a nightmare to maintain,” said Davis Treybig, Principal at Innovation Endeavors. “Earthly is building the future of CI and is the only platform that lets developers build and test pipelines locally with confidence. Vlad and his team have created something special and I’m excited to collaborate as part of the Innovation Endeavors portfolio.”

“Earthly CI has made our build process significantly faster and more streamlined compared to other CI/CD platforms we’ve tried. It reduced our average build time from twenty minutes to three minutes and was quick and straightforward to set up and use,” said Brian Bugh, CTO at [Table Needs](https://tableneeds.com/).

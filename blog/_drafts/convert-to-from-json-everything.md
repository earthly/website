## Convert XML to JSON
To convert from an XML document to JSON there are a couple tools to choose from. `xq` which comes with [`yq`](https://github.com/kislyuk/yq) is the most actively supported.  

Install
```
pip3 install yq
```

In the XML standard ordering of elements is defined and duplicate elements are supported. Neither of these is true of JSON so if you plan to convert back at some point be aware that you may lose ordering and duplicate values.

```
cat sample01.xml
<note>
<to>Tove</to>
<from>Jani</from>
<heading>Reminder</heading>
<body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note> 
```

`xq` is a wrapper around `jq` that converts to XML. To use `xq` as a conversion tool just call it as `xq .`:

``` json
$ xq . < sample.xml
{
  "note": {
    "to": "Tove",
    "from": "Jani",
    "heading": "Reminder",
    "body": "Don't forget me this weekend!"
  }
}
```

##  html to json -> tidy?

install pup
```
brew install pup
```

curl https://earthly.dev/blog/ | pup '.archive__item-title' > test2.html

Ideas:
what can you do by taking everything to JSON?
Can you do CSS style selectors on json and then back to other formats?

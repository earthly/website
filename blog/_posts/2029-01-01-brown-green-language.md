## Introduction
The Stack Overflow Developer Survey[^1] results are a great source of information about developers and how we work.  A favorite statistic that comes from the survey is the **Dreaded Programming Languages** and the **Most Loved Programming Langauge** statistic. Both results come from this question:

> Which programming, scripting, and markup languages have you done
extensive development work in over the past year, and which do you want to work
in over the next year? (If you both worked with the language and want to continue
to do so, please check both boxes in that row.)

A dreaded langauge is one people work with extensively in the current year but don't want to continue to.  A loved language is one you'd like to continue to use.  The results are interesting because they reflect the opions of people who are using the langauge extensively at the time of the survey: there should be no I-heard-kotlin-is-cool effect, where people rank highly things they don't actually use because it is the new hottness.  The inverse should also be true: People who put something on the **Dreaded** list are actually using it. They are not dreading C++ because they heard its complex, but because they have to work in a C++ codebase and feel a real pain.

The great thing about lists like this is that everyone can see what they want in the list and use it to rationilze their own favorites.  With Scala on the dreaded list, I can tell myself that that is probably just data engineering / Spark people throwing off the numbers.  If you are a fan of static types or intepreted languages or OO or FP, you can cherry pick things from this list to support your view.  But there actually is a pattern in this list.  Can you see what it is?

## Code Written Before I was Hired Is the Worst

Old code is the worst.  Find me a file in a code base that has been under active development for more than 3 years and it will be hard to follow.  What started out as a simple rule will develop special cases, and performance optimzations and configuration options.  Real world code evolves to fits its niche and as it does so it becomes more complex and harder to quickly understand.  The reason for this is simple, but the only person who has extensively written about this that I know of is Joel Spolsky. 

> The reason that [ developers ] think the old code is a mess is because of a cardinal, fundamental law of programming: **Itâ€™s harder to read code than to write it.**

Let's call this Joel's Law. Joel's thinks a lot of a lot of things follow from this premise.  Why do most developers think the code they inherited is a mess and want to throw it out and start again? It's because writing something new is cognitively less demaning than starting from scratch. Why are many rewrites doomed to fail? Because on completion the rewritten version is going to be just as hard to read as the original version.

Its easy to build up an understanding of code as you write it, but its hard to build up an understanding of code by reading it.  If you return to code you wrote and think its garbadge it could be because you have grown as a developer but it also could be because you have just forgotten how it works and are intepreting the pain of reading as a code quality problem. PR Reviews are a read only activity and hard if you don't already have a working model of the code in your head.

## Brown Languages

Another thing that follows from this is that languages that you have to read existing code in a lot will seem worse than and the langauges where you mainly write code : software maintenace is less fun than a greenfield rewrite.  I think this effect is actually stronger than the pros and cons of various languages in many cases, and I think this is actually what the survey question is measuring: dreaded langauges are likely to be those used in existing brown field projects and loved langauges are those being used in realiveily new projects.  Lets measure this. [^2]

The Tiobe index claims to measure the "the number of skilled engineers, courses and jobs worldwide" for programming languages. There are probably some problems with how they measure this, but its accurate enough for our purposes.  The top 20 programming languages on their list as of are: Java, C, C++, Python, C#, PHP, JavaScript, VB .Net, Perl, Assembly, Ruby, Pascal, Swift, Objective-C, MATLAB, R, SQL, COBOL, Groovy.  We can use this as our brown language list.


<div class="notice--warning">
**Brown Langauage:** A language that you are more likely to use in existing software maintanence (ie. brown field projects).
TIOBE 2017 Brown Languages: Java, C, C++, C#, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Swift, Perl, Ruby, Assembly, R, Objective-C,  SQL 
</div>

<div class="notice--success">
**Green Langauage:** A language that you are more likely to use in a new project (ie. green field projects).
TIOBE 2017 Green Languages: Go, Rust, TypeScript, Kotlin, Julia, Dart, Scala, Haskell, 
</div>

There is obviously lots of nuance that a list green/ brown split misses - I expect that more green field projects start with Swift than with ObjectiveC, but its not a bad split. There are also more Brown langauges in this list than green, but there is also a lot more existing code out there than is built each years, so :shrug:.  

Now we can answer the question: Do people love and dread these languages or are they really just dreading legacy code, regardless of langauge.

## The Dreaded Brown

``` matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

labels = 'Brown', 'Green'
dreaded_sizes = [10, 2]
overall_languages = [14, 8]
overall_total = 22
dreaded_total = 12
loved_sizes = [6, 7]
loved_total = 13
explode = (0.1, 0)
colors = ["burlywood", "green"]

# Graph one
fig = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig.add_axes([0, 0, .5, .5], aspect=1)
ax1.set_title('Dreaded Languages')
ax1.pie(dreaded_sizes, explode=explode, labels=labels, 
        autopct=lambda p: '{:.0f}'.format(p * dreaded_total / 100),
        shadow=True, 
        startangle=90, 
        colors=colors)
ax1.axis('equal') 

```
<figcaption>
Dreaded Langauges 83% Brown
</figcaption>
</div>

In the top 15 almost all are brown languages. 15 of the 22 langauges in our list are brown, so this is higher than we would expect by chance.  

## Dreaded Outliers?
Haskell and Scala are the only two green languages in the list.  Does this mean they are most dreaded for the qualities of the language alone or is this just noise?  I'm not sure. The people dreading Scala and Haskell are either working on an existing code base, in which case its a brown langauge to them, or they are working on a new project and its not going well. Probably its some of both. They aren't exactly new langauges so its very possible people are being asked to maintain codes bases long after the languages experts have left. Both langauges have a reputation for complexity: does that make the maintance burden particularly acute? It's probably just noise based on my somewhat arbitrary dividing line, but I'd love to hear from you if you are a dreaded outlier.

## The Loved Greens
``` matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

labels = 'Brown', 'Green'
dreaded_sizes = [10, 2]
loved_sizes = [5, 8]
explode = (0.1, 0)
colors = ["burlywood", "green"]
total = 13

fig = plt.figure()

# Graph two
ax2 = fig.add_axes([.5, .0, .5, .5], aspect=1)
ax2.set_title('Loved Languages')
ax2.pie(loved_sizes, explode=explode, labels=labels, 
        autopct=lambda p: '{:.0f}'.format(p * total / 100),
        shadow=True, 
        startangle=90, 
        colors=colors)
ax2.axis('equal') 

```
<figcaption>
Loved Langauges 54% Green
</figcaption>

In the top 15 loved langauges 54% are green. 15 of the 22 langauges in our list are brown, so this is much higher than we would expect by chance.  This seems to confirm my hypothesis: the languages people love are languages that are too new to have giant big ball of mud projects.  Rust and Kotlin are still in the honeymoon phase.  I think Kotlin and Rust are big step forward from Java and C++, but peoples love for working in Kotlin and Rust maybe have as much to do with not having to work in 20 year old code bases than that the code bases are written in Kotlin and Java.


## The Loved Outliers
The most interesting category is languages that are brown but loved: C#, Python, Swift, SQL and JavaScript.  These langauages aren't new: Developers using them are probably not in a honeymoon period - they have had to maintain code for the long term, yet they love the language and want to keep working with it.  C# and Python stand out in this list, they are both quite high on the Loved list and high in the TIOBE rank.  Do Python and C# developers have some secret of code maintanance that Java and Ruby develoeprs never learned? I'm not sure.

## What does all this mean

It seems clear that when deciding if they like a programmign language, people are giving a halo to languages they have used in a green field project and giving horns to languages where they had to do mainteance work.  Some newer programming langauges might be better than old ones but our ability to judge that seems quite biased.

This part is quite speculative, but here is how I might think about overcoming that bias:

## Brown field a green language

## Green field a brown language



, but  they actually You should trust your opinion of programming languages less. They are heavily influenced by the 

## Methodolgy Explained
My hypothesis is that the languages people dread are the languages where they have to deal with piles of old code and that dread and love are not actually measuring aspects of the programming languages in most cases, but the environment in which the language is used.  

We use the July 2016 TIObe index, the oldest available in way back machine, as a proxy for something having lots of code to maintain.  If something was big in 2016 its more likely people now are maintaining code written in it than if it wasn't popular in 2016. If a language is in the top 20 in 2016, we call it a brown langauge.  If it wasn't we call it a green langauge.

There are probably lot of other ways to measure this but I think this captures some important conditions:

### People were writing code in it. 
 
 One possible measure I considered was using the date the programming language was created.  But old languages can just be unpopular in industry and therefore not accumalte a maintenace burden.  Haskell and Python are almost as old as Objective-C yet were not used in industry.

### Normalizing the data

TIOBE and StackOverflow have different ideas of what a programming lanague is.  I removed items from the top 15 lists where TIOBE didn't measure them the same way.  This includes: HTML/CSS (not considered a programming language by tiobe), Shell Scripts (TIOBE seems to measure these differently), VBA (not included in TIOBE).

In the [previous article](/blog/terraform-lambda/) I ported all my AWS infrastructure to Terraform. But in doing so, I was left tracking all my Terraform state in a `terraform.tfstate` file. This has a number of problems.

First, it leaks details into a git repo that don't need to be there. I'm not setting up an RDS database or anything, but if I did, `terraform.tfstate` would have my db credentials in it.

Second, if multiple people were making infra changes we would have a problem, because there would effectively be two versions of `terraform.tfstate` out there.

There are a number of ways to fix this. One is to move to Terraform Cloud, another is env0, but the simplest is to just to put my `terraform.tfstate` into an S3 bucket. And that is what I'm going to do.

## Creating the Bucket

First, I'll create a terraform bucket:

~~~{.groovy caption="main.tf"}
## S3 state bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "tfstate" {
  bucket        = "cloudservices-terraform-state"
}
resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "tfstate" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.tfstate.id
  acl    = "private"
}
~~~

Then I'll apply it:

~~~{.ini caption=">_"}
Initializing the backend...
╷
│ Error: Error loading state:

│       status code: 400, request id: ZB4DTZVN1X27HVR2, host id: 5eZcTebhqUzdTjqRmONR5MWp6orwhKcxJrmdY8+9Y5w/lVZuni3uwmLgWUDtLgci/Tsj02DFAek=

│ source and the destination remain unmodified. Please resolve the
│ above error and try again.
~~~

Oh no! This confusing error means I have a name collision with someone else's S3 bucket in `us-east-1`. A rename fixes things:

~~~{.diff caption="main.tf"}
 resource "aws_s3_bucket" "tfstate" {
-  bucket        = "cloudservices-terraform-state"
+  bucket        = "blog-cloudservices-terraform-state"
 }
~~~

And with that I can apply:

~~~{.ini caption="Output"}
Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_s3_bucket.tfstate: Creating...
aws_s3_bucket.tfstate: Creation complete after 1s [id=blog-cloudservices-terraform-state]
aws_s3_bucket_acl.tfstate: Creating...
aws_s3_bucket_acl.tfstate: Creation complete after 0s [id=blog-cloudservices-terraform-state,private]

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
~~~

Next I need to add the `S3` backend to my terraform section:

~~~{.diff caption="main.tf"}
 terraform {
   required_providers {
     aws = {
       source = "hashicorp/aws"
     }
   }
+  backend "s3" {
+    bucket = "blog-cloudservices-terraform-state"
+    key    = "lambda-api"
+    region = "us-east-1"
+  }
 }
~~~

Then Terraform walks me through the rest of the process:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ terraform plan
~~~

~~~{.bash caption=""}
╷

│ Reason: Backend configuration block has changed

~~~

Following the lead of the error message, I run `terraform init -migrate-state`:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ terraform init -migrate-state
~~~

~~~{.ini caption=""}

Initializing the backend...
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Pre-existing state was found while migrating the previous "local" backend to the
  newly configured "s3" backend. No existing state was found in the newly
  configured "s3" backend. Do you want to copy this state to the new "s3"
  backend? Enter "yes" to copy and "no" to start with an empty state.

  Enter a value: yes


Successfully configured the backend "s3"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v4.18.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
~~~

And with that, all my state is now stored in S3. I can delete `terraform.tfstate` and `terraform.tfstate.backup` and I'm done.

We live in an era of continuous delivery, containers, automation, rich set of programming languages, varying code structures (mono/poly-repos) and open-source. And yet, our most popular CI/CD platform was started 15 years ago when the industry looked very different. CI systems have not changed much since â€” they are still largely glorified bash scripts, and the limitations are starting to show their age. For context, Docker's first release was 7 years ago and Kubernetes is only 5 years old. There is no way Jenkins ("Hudson" back then) could have been built with containers in mind, as Docker didn't even exist at the time.

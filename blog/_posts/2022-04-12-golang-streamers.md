**Meet [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/). We make building software simpler and faster with containerization. If you're keen on honing your coding skills, Earthly can be a game-changer for streamlining your build process. [Give us a try](/).**

I've learned so much from watching other people code. It's never a thing I'm specifically trying to learn. It's more like someone is walking me through a problem, and they do something I didn't know could be done. Maybe they just have a low friction way to exploratory test some set of services, where I could only test things by deploying to staging, or they use some shortcut I didn't know about, and I have to ask them how they did that.

It's silly, but one improvement I learned from code pairing years ago was while debugging something with print lines. I added a `fmt.Print("here")` and then a `fmt.Print("also here")` and eventually a`fmt.Print("Do we get to here as well?")` before someone said "Use numbers". Now I'm always starting with `fmt.Print("1")`, `fmt.Print("2")`, and so on, and it makes my print-line debugging a tiny bit more productive. [^1]

To be able to professionally develop software, you need to learn the tech stack and learn how to get work done. But, to get to the next level – to become an expert – you have to accumulate thousands of tiny pieces of [tacit knowledge](<https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/>) that may not be written down anywhere.

>Tacit knowledge — as opposed to formal knowledge — is knowledge that is difficult to express or extract, and thus more difficult to transfer to others by means of writing it down or verbalizing it. This can include personal wisdom, experience, insight, and intuition. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge)

## 10,000 Hours?

Remember ["Deliberate practice"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice)? It's the idea that you can get good at chess or the violin or leet code problems via grinding out the required, properly structured practice. The ideas behind Deliberate practice are correct but hard to apply past the intermediate level in many fields because they require three things:

> First, it demands that the practice be conducted in a field with well-established training techniques.
>
> Second, it demands that practice be guided in the initial stages by a teacher or coach. This is somewhat linked to the first principle — that the practice occurs in a domain with established training methods mean that a teacher may use known pedagogical techniques to improve student performance.
>
> Third, and last, deliberate practice nearly always involves building or modifying previously acquired skills by focusing on particular aspects of those skills and working to improve them specifically. - [source](https://commoncog.com/blog/the-problems-with-deliberate-practice/)

So, it's easy to go to a Bootcamp and get up to speed on a language, but the stages past that have increasingly limited pedagogical resources and so are way harder to achieve.

Thankfully, there is [a newer school of thought](https://commoncog.com/blog/the-problems-with-deliberate-practice/) suggesting that if you aren't an aspiring chess master or concert violinist, and if you passed the early levels of skill acquisition then there is still a method of learning available to you. You need to find a way to absorb the tacit knowledge of your field. The argument from common cog, translated into the developer domain, is this:

You learn more practical intermediate skills from pairing with experienced developers (tacit knowledge) than you will learn from drilling on LeetCode problems (deliberate practice).

The problem is that code pairing doesn't scale the way the LeetCode problems do. ( Secondary concern: if you need to be good at LeetCode problems to get the job, it doesn't matter how useful they are. It's just a hurdle you need to overcome. )

## Enter Twitch

Code pairing isn't the only way to learn tacit knowledge. According to [Accelerated Expertise](https://www.amazon.ca/Accelerated-Expertise-Training-Proficiency-Complex/dp/184872652X), what you need is a way to observe experts building software[^2]. Enter YouTube and twitch streamers.

> People with expertise in thing X can now film themselves doing thing X, and clued-in practitioners can watch these experts do thing X and become really good themselves. - [The YouTube Revolution in Knowledge Transfer](https://medium.com/@samo.burja/the-youtube-revolution-in-knowledge-transfer-cb701f82096a)

You should read the common-cog series on [tacit knowledge](https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/). But seriously, coding streams are a minor revolution in transferring tacit knowledge. People said building a web browser from scratch was impossible but you can now watch ~80 hours of video of Andreas Kling building [a web browser from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U8T6Abcv9Q&list=PLMOpZvQB55be0Nfytz9q2KC_drvoKtkpS). The implied wisdom behind building a web browser has now been made a lot more widely distributed.

So in my quest to master the tacit knowledge in a particular subfield, I've been looking for streamers and YouTubers who are building in Golang. Here is what I've got so far:

## Other Great Live Coders

I assume that the knowledge you can learn from watching live streamers is proportional to how closely their work matches your work. If you work in PHP on windows, using PhpStorm, you may not learn many low-level workflow tips from watching a Linux developer writing C in vim. But the high-level lessons about how to design a solution or how to decompose a problem, those skills can transfer across domains.

So here are some streamers worth watching regardless of your tech-stack.

### Casey Muratori (Hand Made Hero)

## Send Me Your Tacit Knowledge

So that is a wrap-up of online streamers I am aware of. I tried to focus on Golang people who are streaming their work. Many people create great presentations and tutorials, which are more time-efficient to consume. But, you want to watch an expert at work, not them giving a presentation for tacit knowledge.

I'm sure there are many great streamers that I've missed. Who am I missing? Let me know.

## Implicit CI Know-How

What does this all have to do with Earthly? Isn't Earthly a build tool?

Great question. Earthly is a great piece of engineering, but what makes Earthly exciting is that it encapsulates some previously tacit knowledge of the Earthly team directly into a build tool. Values like [Versatility, Approachability](/blog/platform-values/) and making CI developer-centric.

Also, I just wanted to write up a list of great online programming streamers and explain why they are a valuable resource. But while you are here, take a moment to check out Earthly.

[^1]: This example is not great, but it's hard to communicate examples of tacit knowledge easily. It's subjective and not formally expressed by definition.

[^2]: You also need a method for extracting and absorbing this knowledge. See [NDM](https://commoncog.com/blog/how-to-learn-tacit-knowledge/) for that. Or for a first approximation: emulate what the experts do.

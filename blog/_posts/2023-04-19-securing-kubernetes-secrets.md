**We're [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/). We make building software simpler and faster using containerization. [Check it out](/).**

Storing application passwords, usernames, authentication tokens, and [SSH](/blog/encrypting-data-with-ssh-keys-and-golang) keys as secret objects when building in Kubernetes is safer than hard coding sensitive information into the application codebase. But here's the big question: Are these secrets secure? No, they aren't!

In this tutorial, you will learn why Kubernetes secrets aren't secure by default and also learn how to keep your secrets in Kubernetes sealed to protect your application from cyber vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you'll need to have the following:

- Three or more Linux servers
- This demo uses three Ubuntu 22.04 servers with one server as the master node and two worker nodes.

## Why Kubernetes Secrets Are Not Secure by Default

All secrets and other Kubernetes configuration data are stored in a key-value store called **[ETCD](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/)**. Kubernetes uses this store to keep track of updates, configurations, and other resources like pods, services, and deployments within a [cluster](/blog/kube-bench).

Any change made in the Kubernetes cluster gets updated in the **ETCD** data store and any change made directly in the **ETCD** store will lead to changes in the Kubernetes cluster.

When an unauthorized person or an attacker gets access to the **ETCD** store, they automatically have unlimited access to the entire cluster, having the ability to change the cluster configuration settings and resources.

Talking about secrets in Kubernetes, they are stored in the Kubernetes **ETCD** in an unencrypted form (plain text). Anyone with access to your Kubernetes data-store potentially has access to your secrets. This is why you'll need to ensure the safety of your secrets in Kubernetes because they are clearly not secure by default.

## Ensuring Safety for Kubernetes Secrets

![Safety]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/safety.png)\

In order to ensure that your cluster resources (pods, deployments, services) and secrets don't fall into wrong hands, you need to be sure your secrets are fully secure. You can consider **Enabling [Encryption](/blog/encrypting-data-with-ssh-keys-and-golang) at Rest**,**Configuring RBAC Rules**, and/or  **Securing the ETCD Data-store** itself.

### Enabling Encryption at Rest

Note: The manifest files used in this tutorial can be found on [Github](https://github.com/mercybassey/securing-kubernetes-secrets).

Enabling encryption at rest means encrypting your secrets' data before they are stored in the **ETCD** data store. Since the **ETCD** data store doesn't provide encryption at rest, Kubernetes has its own solution to tackle this using a resource called **[EncryptionConfiguration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/)**.

By default, Kubernetes secrets are base64 encoded which can also be easily decoded. For example, the code snippet below will create a secret object called ***demo*** that will contain a username of ***myapp*** and a password of ***123456***:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl create secret generic demo --from-literal=username=myapp \
--from-literal=password=123456
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating secret Demo]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/tJlHZwG.png)
</div>

When you try to use the `kubectl describe` command to see the full details of this secret `demo`, you will have the below output of which you can't actually see the content or value of this secret:

<div class="wide">
![Describing secret Demo]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/JQpp1VP.png)
</div>

But since Kubernetes secrets are base64 encoded, anyone with knowledge of Kubernetes will know they'll have to simply get the encoded value and then decode it, which is what the command below does.

This command retrieves the *demo* secret object from the cluster and outputs the information in YAML format alongside the keys this secret contains with their base64 encoded values.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl get secret demo -o yaml
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Retrieving Demo secret object in yaml format]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/m4tC0fs.png)
</div>

To get the actual value of this secret, you'll need to run the commands below.

These commands will output the decoded values for both the password and username keys.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}

echo MTIzNDU2 | base64 --decode #Get the actual value of the password key
echo bXlhcHA= | base64 --decode #Gets the actual value of the username key
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Outputting decoded values Demo keys (password and username)]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/b4YaSOO.png)
</div>

Now, this is why you'll need to enable encryption at rest.

#### Configuring the EncryptionConfiguration Manifest File

To create an **EncryptionConfiguration** resource, you need to first create a key and base64 encode it. This key is usually called the **Customer Key**. This is a locally managed key that the **EncryptionConfiguration** resource will use to encrypt your secret data and it has to be at least fifteen characters long.

Execute the command below from your master node to create this key. This command will generate a 32-byte random key and base64 encode it.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating customer key]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/dOjZXWi.png)
</div>

Next, create a file to store the configuration settings for the **EncryptionConfiguration** resource and paste in the following code snippets.

 You can name it whatever you like - this tutorial uses ***enc.yaml***.

~~~{.yaml caption="enc.yaml"}
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: EncryptionConfiguration
resources: #specifies the lists of resources that should be encrypted
  - resources:
      - secrets #specifies that secrets should be encrypted
    providers: #specifies a list of encryption providers that should be used to encrypt the specified resources
      - aescbc: #This provider uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Cipher-Block Chaining (CBC) mode to encrypt the data.
          keys: #field specifies a list of keys that should be used to encrypt the data. In this case, it is specifying a single key named key, with a secret value of "YOUR_CUSTOMER_KEY".
            - name: key
              secret: "YOUR_CUSTOMER_KEY"
      - identity: {} #This provider is an identity transform, meaning that it does not encrypt the data. When set as the first provider, the resource will be decrypted as new values are written 
~~~

This **EncryptionConfiguration** resource above specifies that secrets should be encrypted using the [AES-CBC encryption algorithm](https://proprivacy.com/guides/aes-encryption) (provider) with a specific key (customer key) and that the data should not be encrypted using an identity transform. There are many [other providers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/#providers), too.
Next, you need to configure the encryption configuration in your API server. If you are working in a cluster with multiple nodes, this configuration should only be on the master node.

Move this file into the following directory - `/etc/kubernetes/pki/` .

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
mv enc.yaml /etc/kubernetes/pki
~~~

<div class="notice--info">
 If you'd like to store this file in any other directory, be sure to add that file as a `volumeMount` in the `kube-apiserver` manifest file.

</div>

The **`/etc/kubernetes/pki/`** directory in Kubernetes stores Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) components that are used to secure the communication between various components of a Kubernetes cluster, such as SSL/TLS certificates, private keys, and public keys. These components are essential to ensuring the security and [reliability](/blog/achieving-repeatability) of the cluster by establishing secure and encrypted connections between the different components of the cluster and are mounted on the `kube-apiserver` Pod already.

<div class="wide">
![Viewing **`/etc/kubernetes/pki/`** as volumeMount]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/4PYu24m.png)
</div>

To confirm if the file was successfully moved, execute the command below:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
cat /etc/kubernetes/pki/enc.yaml
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Viewing enc.yaml from **`/etc/kubernetes/pki/`** directory on master node]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/cBsDm7u.png)
</div>

Next, you'll need to edit the manifest file for the `kube-apiserver` static pod. Run the commands below to locate the `kube-apiserver` manifest file:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
cd /etc/kubernetes/manifests
ls
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Locating Kube-apiserver manifest file]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/9Fd0EbJ.png)
</div>

Open up the `kube-apiserver` manifest file using a code editor (nano or vim) and add the following configuration into the `command` section in the `containers` level of the manifest specification configuration settings:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
- --encryption-provider-config=/etc/kubernetes/pki/enc.yaml
~~~

If this is added correctly go ahead and save this setting. On saving the setting your `kube-apiserver` will be down for some minutes.

<div class="wide">
![Getting Nodes]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/DUqXkSo.png)
</div>

After a while, it will be back up—showing the configuration setting was successful—without errors:

<div class="wide">
![Getting Nodes]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/3BNQwtr.png)
</div>

Any secret object you create from now on will be automatically encrypted at rest, but previously created secret objects will not. You need to replace them so the new secret specification will take effect on them.

#### Confirming Encryption at Rest

Since you have already created a secret *demo*, go ahead to replace it using the newly configured specification.

This command essentially retrieves the secrets in the **`default`** namespace, updates them with the latest information, and replaces the existing secrets in the cluster with the updated information.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl get secrets --namespaces=default -o json | kubectl \
replace -f - #replace for a particular namespace
#or
kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl \
replace -f - #replace across all namespaces
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Updating secret (Demo)]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/tqENGrx.png)
</div>

Now, you'll need to go into the **ETCD** data store to confirm your secrets are encrypted at rest. The **ETCD** pod runs in the ***kube-system*** namespace. You can run the below command to confirm:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Viewing etcd-master pod]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/zx4xS9s.png)
</div>

To see how the **demo**  secret is stored in the **ETCD** data store, execute the following command:

~~~{.bash caption="etcd.bash"}

kubectl -n kube-system exec -it etcd-master \
   -- sh -c "ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
   --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt   \
   --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
   --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key  \
   get /registry/secrets/default/demo"
~~~

The code above retrieves the **`demo`** secret stored in the **etcd** registry in the **`default`**namespace using the **etcd** command-line client and secure communication via SSL/TLS certificates.

<div class="wide">
![Retrieving demo secret from ETCD]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/c7QplUZ.png)
</div>

In the image above, you can see the encrypted value of the ***demo***  secret. This shows that your secret is encrypted at rest.

<div class="notice--info">
Since your customer key is stored locally, it can still be compromised or stolen. You might consider using a [KMS provider](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kms-provider/) in your **EncryptionConfiguration** resource. It is considered the safest, strongest and fastest provider. It uses an [envelope encryption](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kms-provider/#kms-v2) scheme to encrypt data in **ETCD**.
</div>

### Configuring RBAC Rules

Enabling encryption at rest is just the tip of the iceberg in keeping your secrets safe. It's essential to also control access to secrets using [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/). RBAC stands for [Role-Based Access Control](https://earthly.dev/blog/guide-rolebased-ctrl/). It answers the questions of who has access to the cluster and what their privileges and limits are. With RBAC, you can create roles with certain permissions in Kubernetes.

Let's say your company has a new senior DevOps engineer named John, who needs to be able to view all secrets in the *marketing* namespace within the cluster and might also need to access all other resources too within the marketing namespace. How will you create John as a user and grant him access to your secrets? You can do this using Kubernetes certificates, a role, and a role-binding Kubernetes resource.

<div class="notice--info">
Since you only need John to access secrets within a particular namespace *marketing* you will need to create a [Role](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) and [RoleBinding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/), else you can consider using [ClusterRole](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) and [ClusterRoleBinding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) which works across all namespaces.

</div>

Kubernetes on its own has no clear idea of what the concept of a user is or what a group is. It simply takes it as a string (the name of the user or group, or the id of the user or group). To identify a user or group, Kubernetes uses a certificate, a certificate signed by the Kubernetes [certificate authority (CA)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/). To add John as a user, you'll need to create a client certificate and add John as the common name in that certificate, and then sign that certificate with the Kubernetes CA and the Kubernetes CA key. Then you create a role to allow John some permissions and privileges and bind that role to the certificate using the same common name John.

So when John tries to access the cluster, Kubernetes will check for the trusted certificate and check if the user intent matches any of the roles where the role-binding user is John.

#### Creating the User's Private Key and Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

Let's continue with the same example. We will start by creating the namespace we want John to only have access to which in this case is the *marketing* namespace using the below command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl create ns marketing
kubectl get ns marketing
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating namespace marketing]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/9pk9uSq.png)
</div>

Then we create a certificate [private key](/blog/creating-and-hosting-your-own-deb-packages-and-apt-repo) for the user, John:

This command uses **OpenSSL** to generate a new RSA private key with a length of 2048 bits and outputs the resulting private key to the "john.key" file.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
openssl genrsa -out john.key 2048
cat john.key
~~~

The parameters in the command stand for the following:

- **`genrsa`**: This parameter tells OpenSSL to generate a new RSA private key.
- **`-out john.key`**: This option specifies the filename of the output private key. The resulting private key will be stored in the file named "john.key".
- **`2048`**: This parameter specifies the key length of the private key in bits. In this case, the private key length is 2048 bits, which is considered [a good length for RSA keys](https://www.keylength.com/en/4/) in modern use cases.

<div class="wide">
![Creating private key for John]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/XkDzXMp.png)
</div>

Once we have successfully created John's certificate private key, we will create a [certificate signing request [(CSR)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#request-signing-process) for John:

This command generates a new CSR using the private key stored in the *john.key* file and outputs the resulting CSR to the *john.csr* file. The subject of the CSR specifies the certificate will be issued to an entity with a common name of *john* and an organization name of *marketing* (namespace in this context).

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}

openssl req -new -key john.key -out john.csr -subj "/CN=john/O=marketing"
cat john.csr
~~~

The parameters in the command stand for the following:

- **`req`**: This parameter tells OpenSSL to generate a new CSR.
- **`-new`**: This option generates a new CSR.
- **`-key john.key`**: This parameter specifies the private key to use when generating the CSR. Here, the private key is stored in the file named "john.key".
- **`-out john.csr`**: This option specifies the filename of the output CSR. The resulting CSR will be stored in the file named "john.csr".
- **`-subj "/CN=john/O=marketing"`**: This parameter specifies the subject of the CSR. The **`/CN=john`**  part of the subject shows the Common Name (CN) of the entity that the certificate will be issued to. The **`/O=marketing`** part of the subject specifies the name of the organization that the entity belongs to.

Copy the *ca.crt* and *ca.key* securely (SCP) from the `/etc/kubernetes/pki` directory from your master node using the below command, you will need the *ca.crt* and *ca.key* on your local machine to sign John's certificate:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
scp root@96.126.114.208:/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.{crt,key} .
ls
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Coping Kubernetes cluster certificate and key]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/tn3sglg.png)
</div>

Now we'll need to sign John's CSR using the Kubernetes cluster's certificate authority (CA).

The following command creates a new X.509 certificate based on the certificate signing request stored in the *john.csr* file. The certificate is signed by the root CA specified in the *ca.crt* and *ca.key* files. The newly generated certificate is stored in the "john.crt" file and is valid for 365 days.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
openssl x509 -req -in john.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key \
 -CAcreateserial -out john.crt -days 365
~~~

The parameters in the command above stand for the following:

- **`x509`**: This parameter tells OpenSSL to create an X.509 certificate.
- **`req`**: This option specifies that a certificate is to be created based on a certificate signing request (CSR).
- **`in john.csr`**: This parameter specifies the input file that contains the CSR. Here, the file named "john.csr" is used as the input.
- **`CA ca.crt`**: This parameter specifies the root certificate authority (CA) certificate that will sign the CSR. The file "ca.crt" contains the root CA certificate.
- **`CAkey ca.key`**: This parameter specifies the private key of the root CA that will sign the CSR. The file "ca.key" contains the root CA private key.
- **`CAcreateserial`**: This option tells OpenSSL to create a new serial number file for the root CA.
- **`out john.crt`**: This option specifies the output file name for the newly generated certificate. The resulting certificate will be stored in the file named "john.crt".
- **`days 365`**: This parameter specifies the number of days for which the certificate will be valid. Here, the certificate will be valid for 365 days.

<div class="notice--info">
 For additional security you can enable Just-in-Time access for a user by reducing the specified number of days for which the certificate should be valid.

</div>

If John's CSR was signed successfully, you should have the following output:

<div class="wide">
![Viewing john's CSR]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/tyA0vV2.png)
</div>

#### Creating the User's KubeConfig File

Since we now have John's certificate private key and certificate signed, we will need to create a Kubernetes config file for John with the certificate and private key so John can access the Kubernetes cluster.

First, you need to get the base64 encoded value for John's certificate (*john.crt*) and John's private key (*john.key*). Execute the below commands to achieve this.

Paste the keys where you can easily access them.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
cat john.crt | base64 -w0
kubectl --kubeconfig john.kubeconfig get \
 pods --namespace marketing
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Generating base64 encoded values for John's certificate and key]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/1LDzPyI.png)
</div>

Now, create a config file for John, for instance, *john.kubeconfig*, and paste in the below configuration settings:

~~~{ caption="john.kubeconfig"}
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: <BASE64 ENCODED ca.crt>
    server: https://<YOUR API SERVER ENDPOINT>
  name: kubernetes
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: kubernetes
    user: john
  name: john@kubernetes
current-context: john@kubernetes
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: john
  user:
    client-certificate-data: <base64 encoded john.crt>
    client-key-data: <base64 encoded john.key>
~~~

<div class="notice--info">
💡 Instead of hardcoding John's config file, you can run the command `**cp ~/.kube/config john.kubeconfig**` to copy your current config into John's. That way you only have to edit the following under the `**contexts**` block - *user(john), context name(john@kubernetes), current-context(john@kubernetes), name(john)* and then the `**client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data`** for John where the configuration settings in the **`cluster`** block is left untouched.

</div>

Now that you have John's config file, you can send it to them and they can add it to their  `.kube` directory as a file to gain access to the cluster via `kubectl` commands.

But that's not all, you just created a user John. John isn't authenticated to run `kubectl` commands on the cluster yet, this is where role and role binding come in.

#### Creating Role and RoleBinding for the User

At this point, if you execute the following command, you will see that John isn't authenticated yet:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl --kubeconfig john.kubeconfig get pods --namespace marketing \
#Gets pods from the marketing namespace
kubectl --kubeconfig john.kubeconfig get pods
#Gets pods from the default namespace
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Using John's config to get pods in Kubernetes cluster]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/yK1pne4.png)
</div>

So we will create a role named "john-marketing" in the Kubernetes cluster with permissions to perform "*get*", "*list*", and "*watch*" actions on pods and secrets resources in the "marketing" namespace using the command below:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl create role john-marketing --verb=get,list,watch \
 --resource=pods,secrets --namespace marketing
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating role (john-marketing)]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/EqVStIP.png)
</div>

Create a role binding named *john-marketing-rolebinding* that binds the role "john-marketing" to the user *john* in the "marketing" namespace.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl create rolebinding john-marketing-rolebinding \
 --role=john-marketing --user=john --namespace marketing
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating role-binding (john-marketing-rolebinding)]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/ArF90pe.png)
</div>

Confirm that the Role and RoleBinding for John were created using these commands:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl get role -n marketing
kubectl get rolebinding -n marketing
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Confirming role and role-binding in the marketing namespace]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/yK1pne4.png)
</div>

Create a secret named *marketing-secret* in the *marketing* namespace containing two key-value pairs: *username* with value *myapp* and *password* with value *123456*.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl create secret generic marketing-secret \
 --from-literal=username=myapp --from-literal=password=123456 \
 -n marketing
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating secret marketing-secret]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/TTpWKY0.png)
</div>

<div class="notice--info">
💡 While you are still here, you can confirm if your newly created secret is encrypted at rest with the following commands :

`kubectl -n kube-system exec -it etcd-master -- sh -c "ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
--cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt   \
--cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
--key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key  \
get /registry/secrets/marketing/marketing-secret"`

</div>

Confirm if John can access this secret using the command below:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl --kubeconfig john.kubeconfig get secrets --namespace marketing
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Verifying john's access to pods in marketing namespace]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/nBdgUsW.png)
</div>

Optionally, you can edit the *john.kubeconfig* file to set the default namespace for John to the *marketing* namespace:

~~~{ caption="john.kubeconfig"}
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: <BASE64 ENCODED ca.crt>
    server: https://<YOUR API SERVER ENDPOINT>
  name: kubernetes
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: kubernetes
    user: john
        namespace: marketing
  name: john@kubernetes
current-context: john@kubernetes
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: john
  user:
    client-certificate-data: <base64 encoded john.crt> #John's certificate
    client-key-data: <base64 encoded john.key> #John's private key
~~~

That way the following command only accesses the secrets in the marking namespace for John without you specifying the namespace explicitly:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl --kubeconfig john.kubeconfig get secrets
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Getting secrets from john.kubeconfig default namespace]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/J563HUr.png)
</div>

<div class="notice--info">
💡 If you'd like to have multiple users access the secret in the *marketing* namespace then you can do the following:
- create new users using the steps above,
- delete the current `RoleBinding` resource, and
- create a new one using the following command:`**kubectl create rolebinding marketing-group-rolebinding --role=john-marketing --group=marketing --namespace marketing**`

</div>

### Securing ETCD

For securing ETCD, you need to limit access to ETCD by granting access only to the kube-apiserver, secure data by restricting node access and use TLS with valid client certificates to secure communication between the API server and ETCD.

See the following [guide](https://github.com/justmeandopensource/kubernetes/blob/master/kubeadm-external-etcd/2%20simple-cluster-tls.md) to achieve this and also, the Kubernetes [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/) for more information.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered Kubernetes secrets security. You now have the tools to safeguard your sensitive info, including enabling data encryption, setting up role-based access control, and securing ETCD. Now it's your turn to keep your secrets under wraps. You've totally got this!

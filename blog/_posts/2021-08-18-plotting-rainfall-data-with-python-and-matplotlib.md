## Where Did All The Rain Go?

It's been a really dry summer here in Victoria BC (and the rest of the province). I couldn't remember the last time it had rained, which got me looking at historical weather data.
Before I knew it, rather than simply look up how many days it's been since it last rained (42 and counting!), I was plotting cumulative annual rainfall.

## Get Some Data

I ended up on Environment Canada's [historic data search page](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html), and ended up with a table of daily weather
recorded at Victoria International Airport, climate ID 1018621 (which is closer to Sidney BC, but I digress). On the right hand side of that page, there was an option to download the
data as CSV. Upon clicking the `Download Data` button, my web browser was redirected to:

~~~
https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/bulk_data_e.html?format=csv&stationID=51337&Year=2021&Month=7&Day=1&time=&timeframe=2&submit=Download+Data
~~~

The website gave me an option to change the range of data to download; however if you squint enough, the above URL looks like an API.
Furthermore, the month and day values didn't seem to affect anything -- since this was annual data, only the year was used.

It's also interesting to note that the `station ID` is different from the `Climate ID` even though Environment Canada defines
"the climate ID is a 7 digit number assigned by the Meteorological Service of Canada to a site where official weather observations are taken, and serves as a permanent, unique identifier."
Perhaps there was a [thought leader](/blog/thought-leaders/) who was suffering from past trauma where a client's definition of a "permanent unique identifier" didn't match up with
a relational databases' definition of a unique identifier, and insisted on creating a lookup table for these different IDs. Again, I digress, back to downloading data.

I wrote a [bash](/blog/understanding-bash) while loop to download this data:

~~~
#!/bin/sh
set -e
for year in $(seq 2013 2021); do
    curl "https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/bulk_data_e.html?format=csv&stationID=51337&Year=${year}&timeframe=2" > victoria-weather-$year.csv
done
~~~

## Parsing the Data

### Using the Standard `csv.reader` Parser

Python offers a standard library for parsing `.csv` files, aptly named `csv`. The `csv` library is fairly low-level and provides a `csv.reader` which can be
used to iterate over rows:

~~~
import csv
with open('data/victoria-weather-2020.csv') as fp:
    reader = csv.reader(fp)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
~~~

This will output something such as

~~~
['\ufeff"Longitude (x)"', 'Latitude (y)', 'Station Name', 'Climate ID', 'Date/Time', 'Year', 'Month', 'Day', 'Data Quality', 'Max Temp (°C)', 'Max Temp Flag', 'Min Temp (°C)', 'Min Temp Flag', 'Mean Temp (°C)', 'Mean Temp Flag', 'Heat Deg Days (°C)', 'Heat Deg Days Flag', 'Cool Deg Days (°C)', 'Cool Deg Days Flag', 'Total Rain (mm)', 'Total Rain Flag', 'Total Snow (cm)', 'Total Snow Flag', 'Total Precip (mm)', 'Total Precip Flag', 'Snow on Grnd (cm)', 'Snow on Grnd Flag', 'Dir of Max Gust (10s deg)', 'Dir of Max Gust Flag', 'Spd of Max Gust (km/h)', 'Spd of Max Gust Flag']
['-123.43', '48.65', 'VICTORIA INTL A', '1018621', '2020-01-01', '2020', '01', '01', '', '12.9', '', '5.5', '', '9.2', '', '8.8', '', '0.0', '', '0.0', 'T', '0.0', '', '0.0', 'T', '', '', '26', '', '59', '']
['-123.43', '48.65', 'VICTORIA INTL A', '1018621', '2020-01-02', '2020', '01', '02', '', '6.0', '', '0.9', '', '3.5', '', '14.5', '', '0.0', '', '14.6', '', '0.0', '', '14.6', '', '', '', '14', '', '45', '']
~~~

The downside of using the standard python `csv.reader` parser, is it simply returns all cells as strings, and doesn't differentiate between cell headers and cell contents.
Furthermore, the underlying data seems to have some sort of unicode character that's not being correctly handled.

### Using the Standard `csv.DictReader` Parser

The `csv` library provides a `csv.DictReader` class which will use the first row as cell headers, and rather than returning the row as a list; instead it will return it as a dictionary:

~~~
{'\ufeff"Longitude (x)"': '-123.43', 'Latitude (y)': '48.65', 'Station Name': 'VICTORIA INTL A', 'Climate ID': '1018621', 'Date/Time': '2020-01-01', 'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '01', 'Data Quality': '', 'Max Temp (°C)': '12.9', 'Max Temp Flag': '', 'Min Temp (°C)': '5.5', 'Min Temp Flag': '', 'Mean Temp (°C)': '9.2', 'Mean Temp Flag': '', 'Heat Deg Days (°C)': '8.8', 'Heat Deg Days Flag': '', 'Cool Deg Days (°C)': '0.0', 'Cool Deg Days Flag': '', 'Total Rain (mm)': '0.0', 'Total Rain Flag': 'T', 'Total Snow (cm)': '0.0', 'Total Snow Flag': '', 'Total Precip (mm)': '0.0', 'Total Precip Flag': 'T', 'Snow on Grnd (cm)': '', 'Snow on Grnd Flag': '', 'Dir of Max Gust (10s deg)': '26', 'Dir of Max Gust Flag': '', 'Spd of Max Gust (km/h)': '59', 'Spd of Max Gust Flag': ''}
~~~

However, the `DictReader` doesn't parse the cell contents and returns everything simply as strings -- leaving all type parsing to the user.
Again we see the incorrectly handled unicode character appear -- this time within the key of every row.

### Using the Pandas Library

The `pandas` library is a third-party python library which provides tools for data analysis and manipulation. We will be using the
`pandas.read_csv` function to parse our data:

~~~
import pandas

weather = pandas.read_csv('data/victoria-weather-2020.csv')
print(weather)
~~~

This will produce output such as:

~~~
     Longitude (x)  Latitude (y)     Station Name  Climate ID   Date/Time  Year  Month  Day  ... Total Precip (mm)  Total Precip Flag Snow on Grnd (cm)  Snow on Grnd Flag Dir of Max Gust (10s deg)  Dir of Max Gust Flag Spd of Max Gust (km/h)  Spd of Max Gust Flag

Notice how the columns have been automatically parsed to an appropriate data type, as well as the column headers are detected.
Row numbers are additionally displayed, as well as the data is displayed as a table. This is possible due to the fact that the
`read_csv` function returns a `pandas.core.frame.DataFrame` data type which among other things, implements the `__str__` method
which is used to render the string which is passed to the `print` function.

## Merging Multiple Datasets

My dataset is split across multiple `csv` files, with each file containing a dataset for a specific year.
My first task is to merge them together. All the datasets are located under the `data` directory, and are named
`victoria-weather-YYYY.csv` (where `YYYY` is the year).

Let's write a function to parse all the data:

~~~
import re
import os
import pandas

def get_data(weather_dir):
    p = re.compile('victoria-weather-[0-9]+.csv')
    data = []
    for filename in sorted(os.listdir(weather_dir)):
        if p.match(filename):
            path = os.path.join(weather_dir, filename)
            yearly_data = pandas.read_csv(path)
            data.append(yearly_data)
    return pandas.concat(data)

weather = get_data('data')
print(weather)
~~~

This function 1) uses a regular expression to ensure we only parse files which match the expected form, which prevents
our program from crashing if any other files existed in the directory, 2) parses each file separately using the
`read_csv` function, 3) saves the returned data frame into the `data` list, then finally 4) concatenates
the data using the `concat` function. This code should output a single data frame containing all the data spanning a decade:

~~~

## Raindrops Keep Falling on my Plots

Let's plot the rainfall! We will use the `matplotlib` library for visualizing this data.

We can extract a single column of the data frame using the column name, e.g. `weather['Total Precip (mm)']`.
This will return a `pandas.core.series.Series` data type, which is similar to a list; however requires
each element in the series to be the same data type. This allows pandas to keep all elements in contiguous
memory, which allows faster SIMD-based operations.

*For another example of comparing generic data types against specific native types, checkout out our post on the [various tricks](/blog/python-timsort-merge)
that python's timsort uses to achieve better performance.*

A pandas series can be converted into a [python list](/blog/python-concatenate-lists) using the `.to_list()` method; e.g. `weather['Total Precip (mm)'].to_list()`

### Plotting the Data Interactively

Here's a quick example of plotting this data interactively:

~~~
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

rainfall = weather['Total Precip (mm)'].to_list()
plt.plot(rainfall)
plt.show()
~~~

This will display a new window, containing a plot of the data:

<div class="wide">
{% picture content-nocrop {{site.pimages}}{{page.slug}}/daily-precipitation-interactive.png --picture --alt {{ Victoria BC daily precipitation interactive plot }} %}
<figcaption>Victoria BC daily precipitation interactive plot</figcaption>
</div>

<div class="notice--info">
It *should* be possible to omit the `.to_list()` call, which would then pass the pandas series data type directly to the matplotlib `plot` function rather than
passing a standard python list; however, there's a bug in matplotlib (or pandas), which produces the following erroneous plot:

{% picture content-nocrop {{site.pimages}}{{page.slug}}/daily-precipitation-interactive-bug.png --picture --alt {{ Victoria BC daily precipitation interactive plot showing a rendering bug }} %}

Notice how this plot has some bizarre lines that criss-cross the plot, and that the data points stop at roughly 350 rather than past 2500?
At a quick glance, this might be an instance of [this bug](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/16266).
</div>

### Saving the Plot Programmatically

Lets revise the previous code to render the plot as a png instead of using an interactive window:

~~~
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# create a new figure that is 10x7 inches
# which is rendered as 100 pixels per inch
# (matplotlib incorrectly refers to this as dots-per-inch, which is a printer term)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10.0, 7.0), dpi=100)

# define axes on the figure to take up the entire figure canvas
ax = fig.add_axes([0, 0, 1, 1])

# plot the rainfall amounts against the axes
ax.plot(rainfall)

# label the axes and title the plot
ax.set_xlabel('days since start of dataset')
ax.set_ylabel('precipitation (mm)')
ax.set_title('Victoria BC daily precipitation')

# save the plot to disk
fig.savefig('daily-precipitation.png', bbox_inches='tight')
~~~

Which will produce:

<div class="wide">
{% picture content-nocrop {{site.pimages}}{{page.slug}}/daily-precipitation.png --picture --alt {{ Victoria BC daily precipitation }} %}
<figcaption>Victoria BC daily precipitation</figcaption>
</div>

### Fixing the X Axis Label to Display the Date

The previous plots didn't make use of the `Date/Time` column from our weather data `csv` files;
instead it was simply displaying the index of the list element.
We need to instruct pandas to parse those columns as dates using the `parse_dates` field.
We will additionally define a date parsing function `yyyymmdd_parser` which will be used to parse the date;
without this function, pandas will attempt to guess the format of the date, which is a best-effort strategy
and may not always work.

~~~
import re
import os
import pandas
import datetime

While it's interesting to get this data plotted, it's not obviously easy to compare one years data against another.

## Comparing Annual Data

Let's slice up the data and plot it against different years.

### Splitting up the Data by Year

We will create a new function that splits up the data by year, and calculates a new field that is days since January 1st of the current year:

~~~
def get_days_since_jan1(date):
    return date.timetuple().tm_yday - 1

def split_data_by_year(weather):
    yearly_rainfall = []
    yearly_days_since_jan1 = []
    current_year = None
    by_year = []
    for i, row in weather.iterrows():
        date = row['Date/Time']
        rainfall = row['Total Precip (mm)']

        if current_year is None:
            current_year = date.year
        elif current_year != date.year:
            by_year.append((current_year, pandas.DataFrame({
                'days_since_jan1': yearly_days_since_jan1,
                'rainfall': yearly_rainfall,
                })))
            yearly_days_since_jan1 = []
            yearly_rainfall = []
            current_year = date.year

        yearly_rainfall.append(rainfall)
        yearly_days_since_jan1.append(get_days_since_jan1(date))

    if current_year is not None:
        by_year.append((current_year, pandas.DataFrame({
            'days_since_jan1': yearly_days_since_jan1,
            'rainfall': yearly_rainfall,
            })))

    return by_year

rainfall_by_year = slice_data_by_year(weather)
print(rainfall_by_year)

~~~

This will then output something similar to:

~~~
[(2014,      days_since_jan1  rainfall
0                 0       1.6
1                 1       6.6
..              ...       ...
363             363       0.0
364             364       0.0
[365 rows x 2 columns]),

(2015,      days_since_jan1  rainfall
0                 0       0.0
1                 1       4.8
..              ...       ...
363             363       0.0
364             364       0.0
[366 rows x 2 columns]),

...
~~~

### Plotting the Data by Year

Rather than call `ax.plot` a single time; in this example we will call it from inside
a for loop once for each year in our data set. We pass the year as a label value, which will
then be displayed on the legend.

~~~
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10.0, 7.0), dpi=100)
ax = fig.add_axes([0, 0, 1, 1])

for year, annual_data in rainfall_by_year:
    days_since_jan1 = annual_data['days_since_jan1'].to_list()
    rainfall = annual_data['rainfall'].to_list()
    ax.plot(days_since_jan1, rainfall, label=year)

# label the axes and title the plot
ax.set_xlabel('days since jan 1st')
ax.set_ylabel('precipitation (mm)')
ax.set_title('Victoria BC daily precipitation since Jan 1st')

ax.legend()

# save the plot to disk
fig.savefig('daily-precipitation-by-year.png', bbox_inches='tight')
~~~

This will produce the following plot:

<div class="wide">
{% picture content-nocrop {{site.pimages}}{{page.slug}}/daily-precipitation-by-year.png --picture --alt {{ Victoria BC daily precipitation since Jan 1st }} %}
<figcaption>Victoria BC daily precipitation with dates</figcaption>
</div>

Well that's interesting, but still rather hard to compare one year against another.
We can fix that by plotting the yearly cumulative sum.

### Plotting Cumulative Annual Rainfall by Year

One potential way to plot the cumulative annual rainfall would be to
modify the `split_data_by_year` function to keep a yearly running total for the rainfall; however,
pandas implements a `cumsum` function which can perform the calculation for us:

~~~
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10.0, 7.0), dpi=100)
ax = fig.add_axes([0, 0, 1, 1])

for year, annual_data in rainfall_by_year:
    days_since_jan1 = annual_data['days_since_jan1'].to_list()
    rainfall = annual_data['rainfall'].cumsum().to_list()
    ax.plot(days_since_jan1, rainfall, label=year)

# label the axes and title the plot
ax.set_xlabel('days since jan 1st')
ax.set_ylabel('precipitation (mm)')
ax.set_title('Victoria BC cumulative annual precipitation')

ax.legend()

# save the plot to disk
fig.savefig('cumulative-annual-precipitation.png', bbox_inches='tight')
~~~

Finally, a clear image starts to appear:

<div class="wide">
{% picture content-nocrop {{site.pimages}}{{page.slug}}/cumulative-annual-precipitation.png --picture --alt {{ Victoria BC cumulative annual precipitation }} %}
<figcaption>Victoria BC cumulative annual precipitation</figcaption>
</div>

### Accounting for Missing Data

If you look closely at the previous plot, there's a few gaps in the data. This occurred due to
the fact that the initial data set contains an empty string `""` in places where either no data is available,
or where the data is zero. Since it's not obvious which case applies, pandas will parse this empty string as `nan` (not-a-number).

In our case, the Environment Canada data encodes no snow as `""` rather than `0` cm. We will instruct pandas to fill in these gaps with a default value of `0`,
using the `fillna()` method:

~~~
weather['Total Precip (mm)'] = weather['Total Precip (mm)'].fillna(0)
weather['Total Snow (cm)'] = weather['Total Snow (cm)'].fillna(0)
~~~

This will produce a plot without gaps:

<div class="wide">
{% picture content-nocrop {{site.pimages}}{{page.slug}}/cumulative-annual-precipitation-no-gaps.png --picture --alt {{ Victoria BC cumulative annual precipitation }} %}
<figcaption>Victoria BC cumulative annual precipitation</figcaption>
</div>

### Reordering the Legend and Fixing the X Axis

The previous plot is difficult to see which colours correspond to which years (especially hard if you are colour blind).
We will re-order the legend from wettest to driest years, with 2021 being dead-last.

To sort the data, we will create a new function `get_total_rainfall`, which returns
a new value for python's `sorted` function to use when sorting values. We return a tuple
so that the year can be used to differentiate between cases where the annual precipitation
is identical.

Additionally, let's fix the x-axis to display the name of the month, rather than an integer value.

~~~
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10.0, 7.0), dpi=100)
ax = fig.add_axes([0, 0, 1, 1])

def get_total_rainfall(val):
    year, annual_data = val
    total_rainfall = annual_data['rainfall'].cumsum().to_list()[-1]
    return (total_rainfall, year)

for year, annual_data in sorted(rainfall_by_year, key=get_total_rainfall, reverse=True):
    days_since_jan1 = annual_data['days_since_jan1'].to_list()
    rainfall = annual_data['rainfall'].cumsum().to_list()
    ax.plot(days_since_jan1, rainfall, label=year)

# format x axis values as month names rather than days since jan 1st
def format_days_since_jan1(days, pos=None):
    date = datetime.date(2020, 1, 1) + datetime.timedelta(days)
    return date.strftime('%b')
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(matplotlib.ticker.FuncFormatter(format_days_since_jan1))

# label the axes and title the plot
ax.set_xlabel('calendar date')
ax.set_ylabel('precipitation (mm)')
ax.set_title('Victoria BC cumulative annual precipitation')

ax.legend()

# save the plot to disk
fig.savefig('cumulative-annual-precipitation-sorted-legend.png', bbox_inches='tight')
~~~

And here we have it, 2021 has been a really dry year here in Victoria:

<div class="wide">
{% picture content-nocrop {{site.pimages}}{{page.slug}}/cumulative-annual-precipitation-sorted-legend.png --picture --alt {{ Victoria BC cumulative annual precipitation v2 }} %}
<figcaption>Victoria BC cumulative annual precipitation v2</figcaption>
</div>

## Accounting for Snow

The previous plots have an error -- they were only plotting rainfall, and not accounting for snowfall.
It's difficult to directly convert snowfall into an equivalent amount of precipitation due to the variety of snow crystal sizes -- some snow is wet, while other snow is fairly dry.
On the west-coast (wet-coast as some call it); when we do get snow, it tends to be fairly wet. We will assume that 13mm of snow is equivalent to 1mm of rain [^1].

Let's revise our `split_data_by_year` function to calculate this.

~~~
def split_data_by_year(weather):
    yearly_rainfall = []
    yearly_days_since_jan1 = []
    current_year = None
    by_year = []
    for i, row in weather.iterrows():
        date = row['Date/Time']
        rainfall = row['Total Precip (mm)']

        # 1cm snow = 10mm snow; 13mm of snow = 1mm of rain
        snowfall = row['Total Snow (cm)'] * 10.0 / 13.0
        rainfall += snowfall

        if current_year is None:
            current_year = date.year
        elif current_year != date.year:
            by_year.append((current_year, pandas.DataFrame({
                'days_since_jan1': yearly_days_since_jan1,
                'rainfall': yearly_rainfall,
                })))
            yearly_days_since_jan1 = []
            yearly_rainfall = []
            current_year = date.year

        yearly_rainfall.append(rainfall)
        yearly_days_since_jan1.append(get_days_since_jan1(date))

    if current_year is not None:
        by_year.append((current_year, pandas.DataFrame({
            'days_since_jan1': yearly_days_since_jan1,
            'rainfall': yearly_rainfall,
            })))

    return by_year
~~~

If you look closely, once we adjust for snow, it turned out that 2017 was a wetter year compared to 2014:

<div class="wide">
{% picture content-nocrop {{site.pimages}}{{page.slug}}/cumulative-annual-precipitation-with-snow.png --picture --alt {{ Victoria BC cumulative annual precipitation v3 }} %}
<figcaption>Victoria BC cumulative annual precipitation including snow</figcaption>
</div>

None of that however changes the fact that it's been a very dry year, and my garden is browner than ever.
On the other hand, my tomatoes have been loving the heat.

If you would like to try generating the above graphs, all the code (and data) can be found under
[github.com/earthly/example-plotting-precipitation](https://github.com/earthly/example-plotting-precipitation).

I've included a nice little Earthfile, so that you can run things without having to worry about any dependency issues:

~~~
deps:
    FROM ubuntu:20.10
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
    RUN pip3 install matplotlib pandas

plot:
    FROM +deps
    WORKDIR /precipitation
    COPY --dir data .
    COPY plot-precipitation.py .
    RUN python3 plot-precipitation.py
    SAVE ARTIFACT cumulative-annual-precipitation.png AS LOCAL ./
~~~

If you're curious how that works then [Better Dependency Management in Python](/blog/python-earthly/) is a great introduction to using Earthly with Python.

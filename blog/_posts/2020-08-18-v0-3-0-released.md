Changes:

- **New** Interactive mode debugger via `-i` option (Experimental). Drops you into a shell in the container, if the build fails.
- **New** Support for Dockerfiles via `FROM DOCKERFILE` command (Beta).[Docs](https://docs.earthly.dev/earthfile#from-dockerfile-beta). [Example](https://github.com/earthly/buildkit/blob/earthly-master/Earthfile).
- **New** Significant speed improvement on Mac (builds are now almost 3x faster).
- **New** Built-in argument `EARTHLY_TARGET_TAG_DOCKER`. It is similar to `EARTHLY_TARGET_TAG`, except that it will produce a valid Docker tag. [See Documentation](https://docs.earthly.dev/earthfile/builtin-args).
- Improved error display in case of build failure
- Reduced repetitive progress output
- Fixed an issue where leftover socket files would cause the build to fail  
​

Upgrading:  
​  
The location of the Earthly cache has moved to a Docker volume. You may remove your previous cache to free up space via

- Upgrading from `0.1.x`: `docker rm -f earthly-buildkitd sudo rm -rf /tmp/`earthly
- Upgrading from `0.2.x`: `docker rm -f earthly-buildkitd sudo rm -rf /var/cache/earthly`

​
In addition, the earth option `-i` has been repurposed. If you were using it to produce images, you will need to change those to `earth --image` instead.

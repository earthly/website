Are you interested in learning more about Kubernetes security? While it's true that [Kubernetes](/blog/automate-micsvcs-in-k8s) secrets provide a secure way to manage sensitive data in your applications, it's also wise to consider additional security measures. In my previous articles, I've covered how to get started with [Kubernetes secrets](/blog/kubernetes-secrets/) and [how to secure them effectively](/blog/securing-kubernetes-secrets/) within the [cluster](/blog/kube-bench).

How about keeping your secrets outside of the Kubernetes cluster? This provides an extra layer of security that can protect your applications in the event of a cluster breach. That's where external secret operators (ESOs) come in. By using an ESO, you can store your secrets securely outside of the Kubernetes cluster while still allowing your applications to access them.

[External secret operators (ESO)](https://external-secrets.io/v0.7.2/introduction/getting-started/) is a Kubernetes operator that allows you to use secrets from centralized third-party secret management systems. This operator reads data from a third-party secret manager and automatically injects their values as Kubernetes secrets.

These centralized third-party secret management systems include AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, and Google Secrets Manager, among others. These centralized third-party secret management systems provide a higher level of security and flexibility for managing secrets within your Kubernetes [deployment](/blog/deployment-strategies) compared to the native Kubernetes secret management.

This tutorial will teach you how to use the external secret operator with HashiCorp vault.

## Prerequisites

To follow along in this tutorial, you'll need to have the following:

- A Linux virtual machine for running your vault instance; this tutorial uses the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS distribution.
- A Kubernetes cluster with at least two nodes. This tutorial uses [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/#nodes).

## How Does the External Secret Operator Work with Vault?

An External Secret Operator is essentially a Kubernetes controller that manages secrets stored outside of the cluster, such as in a HashiCorp Vault or a cloud-based secrets management system like AWS Secrets Manager. When a pod requires access to a particular secret, the External Secret Operator is responsible for retrieving the secret from the external system and making it available to the pod as a Kubernetes secret.

The External Secret Operator works by creating three custom resource definitions (CRDs); the *ClusterSecretStore*, the *SecretStore*, and the *ExternalSecret* CRD.

The ClusterSecretStore CRD is used to define the connection details to the external secret store, such as the endpoint, authentication details, and other configuration settings. The SecretStore CRD is just like the ClusterSecretStore resource but it is namespaced. The ExternalSecret CRD is used to create and manage the Kubernetes secrets based on the configuration defined in either the ClusterSecretStore CRD or the SecretStore CRD.

The External Secret Operator watches for changes to *ExternalSecret* resources and dynamically creates Kubernetes secrets as needed, populating them with the retrieved secret data. This way, the secrets remain secure and can be rotated regularly with no disruption to the applications using them.

<div class="wide">
![How ESO Works with Vault]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/7Qinp9m.png)
</div>

Firstly, the ESO authenticates with Vault using a Vault token created as a secret in the Kubernetes cluster, then the *SecretStore* or *ClusterSecretStore* uses this secret to connect to the Vault server. Next, the *ExternalSecret* CRD uses either the  *SecretStore* or *ClusterSecretStore* to gain access to the actual secret from the Vault server and creates a Kubernetes secret based on the actual secret from Vault to be utilized by the resources configured in the Kubernetes cluster.

## Why Should You Use an External Secret Operator?

ESO allows you to manage secrets outside a Kubernetes cluster, while still allowing the secrets to be used within the cluster. Other reasons why this is useful are:

- **Improved security**: ESO allows you to store sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, outside of your Kubernetes cluster. This makes it more secure, as sensitive information is not stored within the cluster, reducing the risk of compromise.
- **Centralized management**: With an ESO, you can manage your secrets in a centralized location, making it easier to manage and maintain.
- **Better scalability**: External Secret Operators are designed to handle large-scale secrets, making them a great solution for clusters that need to scale.
- **Improved performance**: External Secret Operators can provide improved performance as they are designed to handle secrets efficiently, reducing the load on your [cluster](/blog/kube-bench).
- **Integration with other tools**: External Secret Operators can be integrated with other tools and systems, allowing you to leverage existing tools and processes to manage your secrets.

## Configuring a Vault Production-Ready Server

You can find the manifest files and vault configuration files in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mercybassey/external-secrets-operator).

Prior to getting started with the external secret operator, we'll configure the vault first by installing the vault and spinning up a vault production-ready server as the vault server provides a secure and centralized location to store and manage secrets. In this server, we will create two keys **POSTGRES_USER** and **POSTGRES_PASSWORD**, stored them in a vault, which we will use later to deploy a PostgreSQL database.

To start, retrieve, and add the GPG key for the Hashicorp apt repository into your package manager. This allows your system to verify signed packages from the Hashicorp package repository:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}

curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
~~~

<div class="wide"> ![Retrieving and adding the gpg key for the Hashicorp apt repository]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/6ivw1Eg.png)
</div>

Add the Hashicorp release repository to the apt sources list, allowing for the installation of the Hashicorp software on your machine:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] \
https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
~~~

Install the Vault package via [APT](/blog/creating-and-hosting-your-own-deb-packages-and-apt-repo) using the following command.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
sudo apt install vault
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Installing hashicorp vault]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/GdgI1vc.png)
</div>

With the Vault package installed, we can spin up a vault server /instance to use as a centralized platform for managing secrets.

Confirm if vault was installed successfully with the below command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
vault --version
~~~

You should have some version outputted to you if the installation was successful:

<div class="wide">
![Outputting vault version]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/bPU4iYh.png)
</div>

### Spinning Up a Vault Server

Since you now have vault installed, the next step is to spin up a vault server and create some secrets in it. This step is important as the vault server serves as the main component of all our vault operations (creating secrets, deleting secrets, etc)

Create a [`hcl` file](https://hub.packtpub.com/what-is-hcl-hashicorp-configuration-language-how-does-it-relate-to-terraform-and-why-is-it-growing-in-popularity/) and paste in the following configuration settings, you can name this file what you want, this tutorial uses `vault-config.hcl`.

This configuration file will create a standalone instance of HashiCorp Vault:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
cat <<EOF >> vault-config.hcl
listener "tcp" {
address = "0.0.0.0:8200"
tls_disable = "true"
}

storage "raft" {
path = "./vault/data"
node_id = "node1"
}
cluster_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:8201"
api_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:8200"
EOF

~~~

Confirm the file was created and populated with the configuration settings by executing the command below:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
cat vault-config.hcl
~~~

If you have the below output then the file exists and is populated with the configuration settings:

<div class="wide">
![Confirming vault config file]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/UIDOt1x.png)
</div>

Create the `vault` directory that vault will use to store the data when running in server mode with the [`raft` storage backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/storage/raft):

The command below will create this directory if it doesn't exist.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
mkdir -p vault/data
~~~

Initialize the vault server using the *vault-config.hcl* file:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
vault server -config=vault-config.hcl
~~~

Once the server is up, take note of the *Api address*. You'll need this address when you want to connect to the vault server.

<div class="wide">
![Spinning up the vault server]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/7YT4kYb.png)
</div>

Open up another terminal and execute the following command, this command allows you to connect to the vault server:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
~~~

Initialize the vault server with the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
vault operator init
~~~

This command will return five unseal keys and an initial root token once executed. Make sure to copy the unseal keys and the initial root token to where you can easily access them as they will be used to gain administrative access to the vault server. If you lose access to them, you lose administrative access to the vault server.

<div class="wide">
![Initializing vault]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/8BbOavR.png)
</div>

Export the `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable to the value of your `Initial root Token` using the following command:

This will provide the root token value which will be used to perform privileged operations on the vault server.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
export VAULT_TOKEN=<INITIAL_ROOT_TOKEN_VALUE>
~~~

A vault server is sealed by default when it is started, you need to unseal the Vault server so you can get access to the vault server and the data stored in it. To unseal the server, a quorum of key shares must be provided.

Run the command below to provide one of the key shares and unseal the server:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
vault operator unseal
~~~

Be sure to repeat this step thrice with different unseal keys until you have the below output:

<div class="wide">
![Unsealing vault]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/MCea8QX.png)
</div>

Enable a key-value [secrets engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-secrets-engines) secret engine at a specified path in Vault using the following command, this configures Vault to allow secrets to be stored and retrieved using a key-value (K-V) store approach:

The command below will use a key-value secret engine (kv) at a specified path called *data*. You can choose to name your path whatever you like.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
vault secrets enable -path=data kv
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Enabling a key-value secret engine]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/rhKrFES.png)
</div>

Insert a secret using the following command:

This command stores a key-value pair in a data path called *postgres* in the Vault server. The values stored are **POSTGRES_USER=admin** and **POSTGRES_PASSWORD=123456**.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}

vault kv put data/postgres POSTGRES_USER=admin POSTGRES_PASSWORD=123456
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Inserting secret POSTGRES_USER and POSTGRES_PASSWORD]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/K2b1z7t.png)
</div>

Now run the following command to read this secret:

The command retrieves the key-value pairs stored in the **`postgres`** path of the **`data`**secret engine in Hashicorp Vault.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
vault kv get data/postgres
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Retrieving key-value pairs stored in the (postgres) path of the (data) secret engine]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/WgyQPEr.png)
</div>

Define the [policy](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/policies) rules to allow the ESO to read and retrieve secrets stored in Vault using the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
vault policy write external-secret-operator-policy -<<EOF
path "data/postgres" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
EOF
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating policy in vault]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/ehPYJF5.png)
</div>

Assign the policy to the ESO by creating an authentication token with the necessary permissions using the command below:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}

vault token create -policy="external-secret-operator-policy" -n example
~~~

Be sure to copy the token to somewhere you can easily access:

<div class="wide">
![Assigning token to vault policy]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/9QCPPrA.png)
</div>

## Fetching Secrets from Hashicorp Vault With Eso

Now that you have the Vault server up and have added some secret to it, you are now ready to use the External Secret Operator (ESO) to fetch and use that secret from your HashiCorp vault server.

### Installing the External Secret Operator via Helm

To use the External Secret operator, you need to first install it in your Kubernetes cluster. We will install it via [Helm](https://earthly.dev/blog/helm-k8s-mngr/). You can check for other means of [installation guide](https://external-secrets.io/v0.7.2/introduction/getting-started/).

First, you need to add the External Secrets repository using the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}

helm repo add external-secrets https://charts.external-secrets.io
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Adding external-secrets helm repository]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/y5C8K0C.png)
</div>

This command adds the *external-secrets* repository to your local Helm chart repository list, located at the URL "**[https://charts.external-secrets.io](https://charts.external-secrets.io/)**".

Ensure that you have access to the latest version of the external secret operator chart using the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
helm repo update
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Updating external-secret operator helm chart]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/2HmKRzC.png)
</div>

Now install the External Secret Operator using the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
helm install external-secrets \
    external-secrets/external-secrets \
    -n external-secrets \
    --create-namespace \
    --set installCRDs=true
~~~

This command installs the *external-secrets* package using the Helm package manager. The package is sourced from the *external-secrets* repository and the installation process creates a new namespace named *external-secrets* and sets the *installCRDs* option to *true* so the Custom Resource Definitions for External Secrets Operator are installed with it (the *ClusterSecretStore*, *SecretStore* and *ExternalSecret* CRDs).

<div class="wide">
![Installing external secrets operator via helm]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/f4mlK9n.png)
</div>

Confirm if the external-secret chart is up and running using the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl get all -n external-secrets
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Verifying external-secret installation]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/8kilAXl.png)
</div>

### Creating a Cluster Secret Store

A **`clusterSecretStore`** is a resource that contains references to the secrets that have the credentials to access a third-party secret management system (HashiCorp Vault in this context). It is one of the Custom Resource Definitions that the External secret operator comes with and It can be referenced from all namespaces within your cluster to provide a central gateway to your secrets management system.

Prior to creating the **`clusterSecretStore`**  resource, you need to add your vault token inside your Kubernetes cluster. This could be a policy token or your initial root token. Doing this will enable Kubernetes to communicate with Vault.

Use the following command to create this token:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}

kubectl create secret generic vault-token --from-literal=token=POLICY-TOKEN
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Adding vault auth as a Kubernetes secret]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/XUYQIED.png)
</div>

Confirm this secret is up and running using the following `kubectl` command;

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl get secrets
~~~

You should have the following output:

<div class="wide">
![Verifying secret (vault-token)]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/y6jBFay.png)
</div>

Create a file *cluster-store.yaml* and paste into it the following configuration settings; you can name this file whatever you want.

This file will create a **`ClusterSecretStore`** resource in your Kubernetes cluster using Vault as the provider.

~~~{.yml caption="cluster-store.yml"}
#  cluster-store.yaml 
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterSecretStore #Kubernetes resource type
metadata:
  name: vault-backend #resource name
spec:
  provider:
    vault: #specifies vault as the provider
      server: "https://your-domain:8200" #the address of your vault instance
      path: "data" #path for accessing the secrets
      version: "v1" #Vault API version
      auth:
        tokenSecretRef:
          name: "vault-token" #Use a secret called vault-token
          key: "token" #Use this key to access the vault token
~~~

Go ahead and apply this file to your Kubernetes cluster using the following `kubectl` command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl apply -f cluster-store.yaml
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating (ClusterSecretStore) resource]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/NeZLyaH.png)
</div>

Confirm this resource is active by executing the following `kubectl` command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl get clustersecretstore
~~~

The below output indicates that this resource is Valid:

<div class="wide">
![Verifying ClusterSecretStore resource]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/d2zUgE5.png)
</div>

### Creating an External Secret

Now, we will fetch our Vault secrets using the *ExternalSecret* CRD. An **`ExternalSecret`** resource is the second custom resource definition that comes with the external secret operator. When this resource is created, the external secret operator will interact with the **`ClusterSecretStore`** to retrieve the specified secret and create the corresponding Kubernetes secret resource in the cluster.

Create a file and add the below configuration settings - this tutorial calls the file `ex-secrets.yaml`

~~~{.yml caption="ex-secrets.yml"}
# ex-secrets.yaml 
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: external-secret
spec:
  refreshInterval: "15s" #This specifies the time interval at which \
  the ExternalSecret controller will refresh the secrets.
  secretStoreRef: # This object contains the reference to the \
  Vault secret store to be used.
    name: vault-backend
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
  target: #This specifies the target Kubernetes secret that the \
  #ExternalSecret will create.
    name: postgres-secret #The name of the Kubernetes secret that 
    #will be created.
    creationPolicy: Owner # In this case, the ExternalSecret will \
    #act as the owner of the target Kubernetes Secret.
  data: # This is an array of secret key-value pairs that the \
  #ExternalSecret will retrieve from the Vault secret store and store \
  #in the Kubernetes secret.
    - secretKey: POSTGRES_USER #This specifies the key name for the \
    #secret value in the Kubernetes secret.
      remoteRef: #This is an object that contains the reference to the \
      #secret in the Vault secret store.
        key: data/postgres # This specifies the path to the secret \
        #in the Vault secret store
        property: POSTGRES_USER #This specifies the name of the \
        #secret property to retrieve from the Vault secret.
    - secretKey: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
      remoteRef:
        key: data/postgres
        property: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
~~~

This code defines a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) of type **`ExternalSecret`**
 in the cluster.

- The **`ExternalSecret`** resource specifies the interval at which to refresh the target secret, the name of the **`ClusterSecretStore`** that contains the secret, the target secret to be updated and the properties in the remote secret that will be mapped to the target secret.
- The **`target`** field specifies the name of the target Kubernetes secret that the external secret data will be written to and the policy for creating it if it does not already exist.
- The **`data`** field maps the properties in the remote secret to the target secret.

Create this resource by executing the below `kubectl` command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl apply -f ex-secrets.yaml
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating (ExternalSecret) resource in Kubernetes cluster]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/nmAGxSW.png)
</div>

Confirm this resource has been successfully created by executing the following commands:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}

#lists all the external secret resources that have been \
#created in your cluster in the default namespace
kubectl get externalsecret 
#lists all the CRDs that comes with the ESO that you have \
#configured in your cluster in the default namespace
kubectl get externalsecrets
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Verifying (ExternalSecret) resource and (ExternalSecretOperator) CRDs]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/am5F937.png)
</div>

Confirm the **`ExternalSecret`** resource created the `postgres-secret` and it was configured to using the command below:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl get secrets
~~~

You should see the secret `postgres-secret` created as shown below:

<div class="wide">
![Verifying ExternalSecret target secret (postgres-secret)]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/bsoHoEX.png)
</div>

Confirm the keys contained in this secret using the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl describe secret postgres-secret
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Verifying postgres-secret data]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/3amr1eO.png)
</div>

## Deploying a Postgres Database for Testing

Since we have used the **`ExternalSecret`** resource to create a secret in our Kubernetes cluster, let's see if we can use this secret, by injecting it into a Pod. To confirm, we will create a PostgreSQL instance and use the `postgres-secret` as an [environment variable](/blog/bash-variables).

Create a file and paste in the below configuration settings, this tutorial calls this file *postgres.yaml*

~~~{.yml caption="postgres.yml"}
# postgres.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: postgres-pod
  labels:
    app: postgres
spec:
  containers:
    - name: postgres
      image: postgres
      env:
        - name: POSTGRES_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: postgres-secret
              key: POSTGRES_USER
        - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: postgres-secret
              key: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
      ports:
        - containerPort: 5432
~~~

Create this resource and confirm if it is running using the following commands:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl apply -f postgres.yaml 
kubectl get pods
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating and confirming (postgres-pod) pod]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/GMBB9Og.png)
</div>

Run the following commands to see if you can utilize the `postgres-secret`created by the `ESO` to log into the `postgres-pod` container:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl exec -it postgres-pod bash
psql --username=admin
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Logging into (postgres-pod) container]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/o4ChG9m.png)
</div>

## Using a SecretStore with the ExternalSecret Resource

Just like I mentioned earlier, the external secrets operator extends the Kubernetes API with three custom resource definitions. And up until now, we have seen how to make use of two of those resources, the **`ClusterSecretStore`** and the **`ExternalSecret`** resources. In this section, we will use the third resource, the **`SecretStore`**.

### What Is the SecretStore Resource?

The **`SecretStore`**  resource is a name-spaced resource, which means that it can only be used to store secrets in the same namespace as the **`SecretStore`** object.

First, delete the **`ClusterSecretStore`** resource `kubectl delete ClusterSecretStore vault-backend`, the `vault-token` secret `kubectl delete secret vault-token`  and the `postgres-secret` secret created earlier by the **`ExternalSecret`** resource.

Create a namespace - `example`. This is the namespace we will create the **`SecretStore`** resource in.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl create namespace example
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating namespace (example)]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/gtHjcWW.png)
</div>

### Creating a SecretStore Resource

First, create a secret that the **`ExternalSecret`** resource will use to gain access to your secret from Vault in a namespace - `example`

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl create secret generic vault-token \
--from-literal=token=YOUR-VAULT-POLICY-TOKEN -n example 
~~~

Confirm this secret has been created, using the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl get secrets -n example
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating vault policy token as a Kubernetes secret (vault-token)]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/34azNj4.png)
</div>

Create a file and paste into it the following configuration settings to create a **`SecretStore`** resource. This tutorial calls this file `ss.yaml`.

~~~{.yml caption="ss.yml"}
# ss.yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: vault-backend
  namespace: example
spec:
  provider:
    vault:
      server: "https://your-domain:8200"
      path: "data"
      version: "v1"
      auth:
        tokenSecretRef:
          name: "vault-token"
          key: "token"
~~~

Create and confirm this resource is up and running using the below command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl apply -f ss.yaml
kubectl get secretstore -n example
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating and verifying SecretStore (vault-backend)]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/ih8zGcw.png)
</div>

Now edit the **`ExternalSecret`** configuration file `ex-secrets.yaml` to use a **`SecretStore`** as the **SecretStoreRef** and configure it to be created in the `example` namespace as shown below:

~~~{.yml caption="ex-secrets.yaml"}
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: external-secret
  namespace: example
spec:
  refreshInterval: "15s" 
  secretStoreRef: 
    name: vault-backend
    kind: SecretStore
  target: 
    name: postgres-secret 
    creationPolicy: Owner 
  data: 
    - secretKey: POSTGRES_USER 
      remoteRef: 
        key: data/postgres 
        property: POSTGRES_USER
    - secretKey: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
      remoteRef:
        key: data/postgres
        property: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
~~~

Execute the following commands to create this resource and confirm if it was created in the `example` namespace:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl apply -f ex-secrets.yaml
kubectl get externalsecret -n example
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating and verifying ExternalSecret resource]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/8fuSfDF.png)
</div>

Run the command to check for the secret `postgres-secret` that you expect the **`ExternalSecret`** resource to create using the command below:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl get secret -n namespace
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Verifying ExternalSecret resource target secret (postgres-secret)]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/BogK0YT.png)
</div>

## Conclusion

I hope you understand how useful the External Secret Operator is in Kubernetes. You've learned how to use it with HashiCorp vault by configuring a ClusterSecretStore, SecretStore, and an ExternalSecret resource. You now know how to secure your Kubernetes secrets further. You can explore further using another key management system if you like.

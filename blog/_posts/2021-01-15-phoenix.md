Aaron Renner has written up his experience of [using Earthly for building and testing the popular elixir based Phoenix project](https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/improving-testing-and-continuous-integration-in-phoenix).

> All of this said, I'm excited to announce that the Phoenix project's CI pipeline is now powered by Earthly.

>Adam Gordon Bell submitted the PR in early October and was awesome to work with as we went through the evaluation process. The final version is more complex than the examples found in this article and continues to evolve. It's the early days, but it's been a huge win for my workflow, personally. It doesn't take the place of running tests locally while I'm doing TDD cycles, but I've made a habit of running the Earthly build locally before I push a PR to minimize the number of failed builds I have on Github Actions.

>Personally, I think Earthly is the start of the next-generation of CI tools that will help reduce the gap between local and CI builds. If you have time, I'd highly recommend taking it for a spin and seeing what you think.

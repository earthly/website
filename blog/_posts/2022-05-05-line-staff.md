Let's talk about a career in tech. Not about salary or whether you should work for FANG though. Instead I want to talk about how where you fit in a specific organization influences what that job is like and what skills and strengths you'll develop as a software engineer.

Imagine a simplified world there is only enterprise software and there are only two broad types of software jobs. 

( What is enterprise software? It's boring software for large corporations. My story is going to apply to other areas as well, but bear with me here. )

Ok, so only enterprise software exists and so you can work at two types of companies. First you could work at that large enterprise, where you might build an maintain their internal billing system or something. Or you could work outside the large enterprises selling software and development services to them. 

So, pretend the year is 2000, and except there is no dotcom boom and you can either work at General Electric or Thought Works and in both cases you'll be writing billing and HR software using Java and C++.

These jobs may sound very similar. Some even argue that an internal dev team and external consulting team are very similar. At both Thought Works and GE you'll be working inside a large entreprise, you'll be working to understand the gaps that the current system has and coming up with and implementing a solution for them. But the biggest difference between these jobs is that one is a line position and the other is a staff position.

## Line And Staff

The division of employees into line and staff comes from the military. A line officer can fight on the front line. They directly contribute to the core mission of the miltary – presumably winning the war. A staff officer contributes only in a supporting role. They are doctors, IT people and adminstrators.

> Staff and line are names given to different types of functions in organizations. A "line function" is one that directly advances an organization in its core work. This always includes production and sales, and sometimes marketing.[1] A "staff function" supports the organization with specialized advisory and support functions. For example, human resources, accounting, public relations and the legal department are generally considered to be staff functions.[2] Both terms originated in the military. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_and_line

I've never heard this staff vs line distinction used in tech but I think it's an important distinction to keep in mind. Staff and line roles are very different.

Back to our example, the dev team at GE is a staff developer position. ( This is not in the sense of the seniory role called Staff engineer, different concept – you should pretend that term does not exist for now. ) The billing software supports GE, it is not a GE product. However, for the team at Thought Works, even if working on the same billing system at GE, the stakes are different. Someone at thoughtworks sold GE on the idea that Thought works could do a great job at redoing the billing software and GE is probably paying a lot and if things go well, they will make into a whitepaper case study and use it land that next contract working on an HR system at Barkelys Bank. If things go badly, and someone at the client complains about you, you might get switched out for someone else, and you might end up on the 'the bench' which is a half-step away from a lay-off. Because thoughtworks may have 3 other teams who are going to start working on other projects at the client and they can't afford to have it go sideways.

Other the other hand, if someone in billing complains about you and you work on the internal dev team, you boss will deflect that and life will go on.

Things aren't quite as clear the miltary, where its everyone knows if they have the type of job where someone might shoot at them or not. There are more gradations of roles, but if you make a product your organization makes money from, you are line employee and the farther away you get from that the more of a staff employee you are. For instance, if you work at a software company, but on maintaining the hand-rolled internal ticketing system, you are probably staff.

One is not better than the other, they are just different. Each has career advantages and disadvantges. And I'll get to that shorthly but first let me beat this distinction to death.

## More Examples

 - Product Company: You build the software the company sells. **Line.**
- In house ERP Dev: You are the expert at customizing the ERP software in a dev team at a large accounting firm. **Staff**.
- ERP software company: You add new stuff to SAP, at SAP. **Line**
- You are a in-house recruiter, at a software company. **Staff**
- You are a recruiter at a recruiting company. **Line**
- You work in PR at Google. **Staff**
- You work in PR at a PR firm. **Line**
- You're a doctor on a miltary base. **Staff**
- You're a doctor at medical hospital. **Line**

## Something about devops

Is devops, taking something that was traditionally staff (ops) and realizing that it can be supportive enough that it becomes a strategic advantage. 

What are SRE, Platform Engineering, and Solutions architects in this world? I think it depends on the org. A platform engineering team certainly is in a supporting role in the org, but if the company produces software as its main product, then the roles will feel like line roles. That's why its important to look at the org chart.

## The Org Chart

The easiest way to tell if you are line or staff is to look at the org chart of your business. If the thing you do makes up the bulk of the org chart, you are line. There will always be less doctors than soldgiers in the army and less IT people than accountants at the accouting firm.

## Being a Line Software Developer

- Advantage: You'll get great at software development
- Advantage: You'll work with a lot of great developers
- You'll speacilze and become great in your speality



## Advantages to Staff

Promotion and retirement. 

If most of the teams in the org chart are filled with people like you then its going to be hard to climb the ranks of the organization. I once managed tweleve people as a engineering manager and my boss, a director managed around that many managers himself. If everyone in that group aspired to be a VP at somepoint that is 144 people just under that one director viaing for a job. Meanwhile, in the human resources group they had 5 people, including 1 VP, 2 directors reporting to a Cheif People Officer. If you aspire for the C suit of a large company, A staff position is the way to go. A friend who retired from a product company to a City IT job, his boss reports to the city council.

## Staff Role = underrated

I work at Earthly, a venture funded developer tools company. Our company contains a lot of software developers and our customers are software developers and our product is a product for building software. The world of development can get a little insular and inward facing when everything is software all the time. 

Being a developer at a non-software producing company has so many advantages that never get talked about. In fact, if you hang out online with other developers, it feels like these roles don't even exist. But they do exist and they can be great. 

Retiring to a staff role is a common pattern I've seen. You used to work at Hooli on their data backends, but now you work at a Utility company who has a much smaller version of the same challenges. You get to be the expert who can solve real business problems with your database experticne and also work at a company where tenure's are in the decades and planning is done over simlar timelines. ( Finnaly you get off the sprint treadmill and you'll have so many opportunties to start sentenses with "When I was at Hooli ..." ).

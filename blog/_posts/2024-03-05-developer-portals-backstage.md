Medium to large companies typically use several different components and services for operations, including apps developed in-house, third-party services such as Google Cloud Provider (GCP) or Amazon Web Services (AWS), and third-party APIs. Managing all these services can become a complex task, which is why [Backstage](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage), an open source project, helps companies create developer portals that consolidate all their services, configurations, and secrets into one place. With Backstage, the portal that you create gives you a place to document each of your services and provides an overview of the services in use, their locations, and interdependencies.

In this article, you'll learn how to create a developer portal with Backstage.

## What Is Backstage?

Picture this: you're a developer at a growing company with a popular app. One day, you get a complaint from a customer that they're not receiving emails from the app. You put your debugging glasses on and realize that the app uses a third-party service for sending emails. However, you have no idea what service is being used. You ask around, and it turns out that the developer who set up this integration has left the company. After an entire week of brainstorming, you finally succeed in replacing the component responsible for emails with a shiny new component. But now you realize that some other crucial functionality of the app is broken because you had no idea it depended on the old mailing system.

This is a familiar story in many organizations. As you add more and more software, services, and APIs to your tech stack, keeping track of them becomes increasingly challenging.

Backstage was created because [Spotify ran into this same issue](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SpotifyScaling.pdf). Spotify needed a place to collect and document all its services in one place, and Backstage allowed it to do just that and eventually grow and become the company it is today.

In 2020, [Spotify donated Backstage](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/background/) to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), where it received the love and support of the open source community and was developed into a community-driven effort aimed at simplifying development.

### The Benefits of Backstage

At its core, Backstage is a developer portal. A developer portal works as the heart of development and allows developers to quickly find what they need.

The following are a few of the reasons Backstage is a great developer portal:

* Backstage comes with a robust [Software Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/), a centralized system that consolidates and tracks ownership and metadata for all the software in your tech stack (services, websites, libraries, data pipelines, and so on). It works as a single source of truth by providing you with information about the software and letting you explore the dependencies between components.
* Backstage's [TechDocs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/) feature lets you create a central documentation hub right inside the developer portal. Developers write code that lives with the components, and Backstage can pull this documentation into a centralized system.
* [Backstage Search](https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/) helps you quickly find the information you need.
* Backstage's [predefined templates](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/) help you easily create components inside Backstage.
* Backstage can be [integrated](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/) with various third-party services with little effort.
* By using [existing plugins](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/) or [creating your own](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/create-a-plugin), you can customize Backstage to fit your needs.

Additionally, as previously stated, Backstage is open source, which means you can modify it to your heart's content and host it in your own architecture.

If some of these features interest you, read on! In the next section, you'll get a quick hands-on tutorial on how to set up Backstage and use its Software Catalog.

## Building a Developer Portal with Backstage

Before you begin this tutorial, you'll need the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed as well as [Yarn Classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed and set up.

Note that you can upgrade to the latest version of Yarn later on, but to create the Backstage instance, you'll need Yarn Classic.

You'll also need to install and set up [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) on your computer.

### Setting Up a Backstage Instance

To begin, you need to create a Backstage instance by running the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
npx @backstage/create-app@latest
~~~

When you're prompted, enter the name of the directory where you want to set up the instance (*eg* `backstage`).

Once the setup is complete, your output will look like this:

~~~{ caption="Output"}
// Some output omitted

 Moving to final location:
  moving        backstage âœ”
  init          git repository â—œ
 Installing dependencies:
  init          git repository âœ”
  determining   yarn version âœ”
  executing     yarn install âœ”
  executing     yarn tsc âœ”

ðŸ¥‡  Successfully created backstage


 All set! Now you might want to:
  Run the app: cd backstage && yarn dev
  Set up the software catalog: https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/configuration
  Add authentication: https://backstage.io/docs/auth/
~~~

Navigate to the `backstage` directory and install the dependencies by running `npm install`.

Then, start the Backstage server with the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
yarn dev
~~~

This launches a Backstage instance at `http://localhost:3000` and opens a browser window where you'll be greeted with the default Backstage instance:

<div class="wide">
![The default Backstage instance]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/yiiFvew.png)
</div>

Before you proceed with the rest of the article, you'll need to configure Backstage to use PostgreSQL as the database. By default, Backstage works with an in-memory database, which means any changes you make will be lost when you restart the server. To prevent that, a database such as PostgreSQL is needed where Backstage can store the data.

To configure PostgreSQL, install the `pg` library by running the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
yarn add -cwd packages/backend pg
~~~

Open the `app-config.yaml` file where the configuration for Backstage is stored. You'll find a `database` key that looks like this:

~~~{.yaml caption="app-config.yaml"}
database:
    client: better-sqlite3
    connection: ':memory:'
~~~

By default, this sets Backstage up to use an in-memory database. You could edit this file to set up the PostgreSQL connection, but that's not a secure approach because the configuration contains sensitive information, such as the database URL and password. The `app-config.yaml` file is checked into version control, which means anyone who has access to your company's version control system can read it.

It's better to use `app-config.local.yaml` for sensitive configurations. This file is not checked into version control, and any configuration in this file overrides the same from `app-config.yaml`. So, open `app-config.local.yaml` and add the following:

~~~{.yaml caption="app-config.local.yaml"}
# Backstage override configuration for your local development environment
backend:
  database:
    client: pg
    connection:
      host: 127.0.0.1                
      port: 5432                     
      user: USER
      password: PASSWORD
~~~

Replace `USER` with the PostgreSQL user and `PASSWORD` with the password.

Restart the Backstage server and look for a line like this:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
Performing database migration
~~~

This means the database connection is successful.

### Setting Up GitHub Authentication

The default Backstage instance doesn't perform any authentication, and anyone who can access the URL can access the Backstage instance. It's a good idea to set up authentication for security purposes. With just a few lines of code, you can set up a GitHub login page using OAuth.

First, go to [https://github.com/settings/applications/new](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) and create a new OAuth app. Enter `http://localhost:3000` in the **Homepage URL** field and `http://localhost:7007/api/auth/github/handler/frame` as the **Authorization callback URL**. Give the app a name and click **Register application**:

<div class="wide">
![Creating a new OAuth app]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/oHWzm19.png)
</div>

On the next page, you'll be shown a client ID that you'll need to copy. Click the **Generate a new client secret** button and copy the generated client secret:

<div class="wide">
![Generating a client secret]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/m3uFngR.png)
</div>

Open the `app-config.local.yaml` file and paste the following YAML code into it:

~~~{.yaml caption="app-config.local.yaml"}
auth:
  # See https://backstage.io/docs/auth/ to learn about auth providers
  environment: development
  providers:
    github:
      development:
        clientId: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
        clientSecret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
~~~

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with the client ID and client secret you acquired.

Open `packages/app/src/App.tsx` and add the following imports:

~~~{.tsx caption="App.tsx"}
import { githubAuthApiRef } from '@backstage/core-plugin-api';
import { SignInPage } from '@backstage/core-components';
~~~

Search for `const app = createApp({`, and below `apis`, add the following:

~~~{.tsx caption="App.tsx"}
components: {
  SignInPage: props => (
    <SignInPage
      {...props}
      auto
      provider={ {
        id: 'github-auth-provider',
        title: 'GitHub',
        message: 'Sign in using GitHub',
        apiRef: githubAuthApiRef,
      } }
    />
  ),
},
~~~

Restart the server, and you'll be prompted with a login screen:

<div class="wide">
![The GitHub login screen]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/YefMfi1.png)
</div>

Once you log in with GitHub, navigate to **Settings** and verify that your name and email have been taken from GitHub:

<div class="wide">
![The user profile]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/bNnAXJC.png)
</div>

**Note:** By default, Backstage comes with a guest [sign-in resolver](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/identity-resolver#sign-in-resolvers). With this resolver, all users share a single "guest" identity. You can read more about configuring user identities in the [official docs](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/identity-resolver#backstage-user-identity).

### Exploring the Software Catalog

To better understand some of the benefits of Backstage's Software Catalog system, let's imagine a scenario where your company has a product with a Node.js backend and a Python frontend client. You want to add them to Backstage's Software Catalog.

The apps have already been created and hosted on GitHub to make your life easier. Here's the [Node.js backend](https://github.com/heraldofsolace/nodejs-server-server) and the [Python client](https://github.com/heraldofsolace/python-client). You'll be modifying the repos, so you must *fork them to your GitHub account* and clone them to your local computer. If you prefer to simply see the end result, both repos have a branch named `final` that contains the final code.

**Note:** It isn't necessary to run the apps to register them in Backstage, but if you want to run them, you can find instructions in the `README` files in the repos.

To register components in Backstage, each component must have a [`catalog-info.yaml` file](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format). This file contains metadata about the project and acts as the single source of truth for the components. Here, you'll add the `catalog-info.yaml` files to both repos.

To start, create a file named `catalog-info.yaml` in the root of the Node.js app with the following code:

~~~{.yaml caption="catalog-info.yaml"}
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: Blog-App
  description: This is a dummy Node.js app
  tags:
    - node

spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: experimental
  owner: user:guest
~~~

In this code, the `kind` key sets the [kind](https://backstage.io/docs/architecture-decisions/adrs-adr005/) of entity. In this case, `Component` denotes that it's a piece of software that you're registering to Backstage. The `metadata` key records information related to the component, such as name, description, and [annotations](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/well-known-annotations). Finally, in the `spec` key, you set the [type](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format#spectype-required), [lifecycle](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format#speclifecycle-required), and [owner](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format#specowner-required) of the component.

Commit this file and push the changes to your GitHub repo.

In the Backstage dashboard, click **Create**, and then click **REGISTER EXISTING COMPONENT**:

<div class="wide">
![Creating a new component]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/SGUUZut.png)
</div>

In the **URL** field, enter the URL to your repo's `catalog-info.yaml` file. It should be something like `https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_NAME>/blob/<BRANCH_NAME>/catalog-info.yaml`. Replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>` with your GitHub username, `<YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_NAME>` with the name of the repo in your account, and `<BRANCH_NAME>` with the name of the branch you're working on:

<div class="wide">
![First step of registering a component]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/2uQmAdN.png)
</div>

When you click **ANALYZE**, Backstage fetches the `catalog-info.yaml` file and extracts the entities from it:

<div class="wide">
![Importing the component]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/ByoLtAe.png)
</div>

Click **IMPORT**, and after the component is registered, click **View Component**. You'll be taken to the entity page:

<div class="wide">
![The component page]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/hKHqJfR.png)
</div>

You can see that the name and description have been fetched from the `catalog-info.yaml` file. On the left side, you'll find a **VIEW SOURCE** button that takes you straight to the GitHub repo of the app. On the right-hand side, you'll find a relations graph that shows the relations of this entity with other entities.

Right now, you can see that the `user:guest` entity has an `ownerOf/ownedBy` relationship with this component.

#### Adding APIs to the Catalog

APIs are at the center of modern software development. Almost every piece of software either exposes an API for other software to communicate with or consumes an API to communicate with other software. The `Blog-App` component also exposes an API. With Backstage, you can also catalog the API in the Software Catalog.

Open the `catalog-info.yaml` file and add the following in the `spec` key:

~~~{.yaml caption="catolog-info.yaml"}
providesApis:
  - blog-api
~~~

This tells Backstage that the `Blog-App` component provides an API named `blog-api`.

Now, let's define the API. Add the code below at the end of the `catalog-info.yaml` file. As before, replace the GitHub-related parts with information specific to your repo:

~~~{.yaml caption="catolog-info.yaml"}
---
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: API
metadata:
  name: blog-api
  description: The Blog API
spec:
  type: openapi
  lifecycle: experimental
  owner: user:guest
  definition:
    $text: https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_NAME>/blob/<BRANCH_NAME>/api/swagger.yaml
~~~

Notice that `kind` is set to `API` because this is an API entity, and the `definition` key refers to the `api/swagger.yaml` file in the repo. Backstage can generate a Swagger UI using the Swagger file.

The full `catalog-info.yaml` file looks like this:

~~~{.yaml caption="catolog-info.yaml"}
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: Blog-App
  description: This is a dummy Node.js app
  annotations:
    backstage.io/managed-by-location: https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_NAME>/blob/<BRANCH_NAME>/catalog-info.yaml
  tags:
    - node

spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: experimental
  owner: user:guest
  providesApis:
    - blog-api

---
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: API
metadata:
  name: blog-api
  description: The Blog API
spec:
  type: openapi
  lifecycle: experimental
  owner: user:guest
  definition:
    $text: https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_NAME>/blob/<BRANCH_NAME>/api/swagger.yaml
~~~

Commit and push the changes.

Once Backstage registers a component, it periodically refreshes the `catalog-info.yaml` file by re-fetching it. That means once you push your changes, you should see them reflected automatically after a few minutes.

Once the component is refreshed, you'll see a new entity has been added to the relations graph. The `api:blog-api` entity has an `apiProvidedBy/providesApi` relationship with the `Blog-App` component:

<div class="wide">
![The updated relations graph]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/rwJsaYE.png)
</div>

If you go to the **API** tab, you'll see `blog-api` listed under **Provided APIs**:

<div class="wide">
![The list of APIs]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/1hrAvfR.png)
</div>

Click **`blog-api`**, and you'll see that a Swagger UI has been generated from the Swagger file:

<div class="wide">
![The generated Swagger UI]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/kodsuho.png)
</div>

#### Adding Dependencies to the Catalog

In a real-world project, components often depend on other components. With Backstage's robust Software Catalog, you can record the dependencies between components.

In this section, you'll focus on the Python client, which depends on the `Blog-App` component and consumes the `blog-api` API.

Add a `catalog-info.yaml` file in the repo for the Python client:

~~~{.yaml caption="catolog-info.yaml"}
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: Python-Client
  description: This is a dummy Python app
  tags:
    - python
    - web
spec:
  type: website
  lifecycle: experimental
  owner: user:guest
  consumesApis:
    - api:blog-api
  dependsOn:
    - component:Blog-App
~~~

This is very similar to the metadata for `Blog-App`. The `consumesApis` key tells Backstage that this component consumes the `blog-api` API, and the `dependsOn` key tells Backstage that this component is dependent on the `Blog-App` component.

As before, commit and push this code and register the component. You'll notice that the relations graph shows how the `Python-Client` component is related to the `blog-api` API and the `Blog-App` component:

<div class="wide">
![The newly registered component]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/JW3G1La.png)
</div>

If you go to the **DEPENDENCIES** tab, you'll see that the `Blog-App` component shows up as a dependency:

<div class="wide">
![The list of dependencies]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/mcMten3.png)
</div>

Click **`Blog-App`** to be taken to its overview page, where you'll see the relations graph has been updated to include the new `Python-Client` component:

<div class="wide">
![The updated relations graph]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/IwlemPC.png)
</div>

Congratulations! Now you not only have a catalog of your components, but you also have a clear understanding of how they're related to each other.

**This article examines how Bazel and TypeScript work together for reliable builds. Earthly guarantees consistent and reproducible builds for Bazel users in different environments. [Learn more about Earthly](https://cloud.earthly.dev/login).**

[Bazel](https://earthly.dev/blog/bazel-build/) is an open source project originally created by Google, refined, and tested for years to run heavy-duty, mission-critical services, and applications. It is a great choice for building, and testing projects. Bazel's advanced distributed caching execution creates fast incremental and customizable builds by only rebuilding what is necessary. It works across several languages and platforms, such as Java, Go, and JavaScript, and across operating systems, such as IOS, Android, Linux, and Windows.

Bazel automates software builds and tests for tasks like running compilers and linkers to produce executable programs and libraries, such as transforming a JAVA file into a JAR executable. Bazel can be compared to tools like [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/), [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), but it rises above the crop due to its multilanguage and multiplatform support. It comes with a customizable high-level language, [Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark), that describes how a project should be built. Bazel's scalability allows it to grow along with your codebase and organization. It can handle codebases of any size, whether huge monolith repositories or multiple repositories.

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) builds with Bazel are much faster when used with [Bazel's remote execution](https://bazel.build/remote/rbe) feature, which allows you to build and test in parallel across multiple machines, such as a data center. This means that you can horizontally scale your builds. Bazel also supports remote caching, which can greatly improve the development experience by avoiding discrepancies between development environments, like one user using macOS and another using Windows.

This tutorial explores how experienced developers can add Bazel for a TypeScript project to run fast and customizable builds. You'll learn to customize Bazel to suit your needs with the use of [Bazel rules](https://bazel.build/extending/rules). You'll also learn to add tests, run them with Bazel, and then publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## TypeScript and Bazel

TypeScript is a language built with JavaScript as a base. It is a superset of JavaScript, which means it inherits every possible feature in JavaScript. TypeScript comes with two advantages. First, it [transpiles](https://dev.to/kealanparr/compiling-vs-transpiling-3h9i) TypeScript into JavaScript so that all the advanced ECMAScript features not available across all browsers can be provided with a [polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill). Second, it enforces static typing to catch potential issues and errors earlier in the software development lifecycle.

While using Bazel, you will come across several Bazel rules built around the TypeScript compiler that can be used while configuring Bazel. Bazel rules, which are usually called `BUILD` files, are defined as a set of commands that operate on input files to produce an output, for instance, transpiling a TypeScript file to a JavaScript file. These rules often come as part of a Bazel package; for instance, [rules_nodejs](https://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_nodejs). Some of these rules are as follows:

1. **`tsc`:** This is the built-in TypeScript compiler developed by the team at Microsoft. After loading [rules_nodejs](https://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_nodejs/TypeScript.html), `tsc` can be exposed in the Bazel `BUILD` file by adding the load statement `load("@npm//typescript:index.bzl", "tsc")` to it. Here's an example [usage](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/blob/3.2.2/internal/node/test/BUILD.bazel#L491-L507) of `tsc` in the Bazel config file.

2. **`ts_config`:** This rule is used for adding your TypeScript configuration file to Bazel. With this rule, you can pass a `tsconfig.json` file to it or even add an additional JSON config file with it via the `deps` option.

3. **`ts_project`:** This is a Bazel rule that can serve as a replacement for the `tsc` rule. It allows for a lot of options, such as `srcs`, the source data to be transpiled; `out_dir`, the directory where the output files should go; `tsconfig`, the TSConfig file to use; or a JSON object containing transpiling rules. Any rule that works with `tsc` should work with `ts_project`. See the [docs](https://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_nodejs/TypeScript.html#ts_project) to learn more about `ts_project`.

See the [rules_nodejs docs](https://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_nodejs/TypeScript.html) for more Bazel TypeScript rules.

## Build a TypeScript App with Bazel

For the purpose of this tutorial, you'll will put together a basic TypeScript application and then build and test it with Bazel. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your computer.

Start by creating a directory called `demo_bzl_app`:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ mkdir demo_bzl_app && cd demo_bzl_app
~~~

Start a Node.js project by running the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ npm init
~~~

Next, install TypeScript:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ npm config set save-prefix=''
$ npm install typescript@4.9.5 --save-dev
~~~

In your directory, you should now have a `package.json` file and a `package-lock.json` file.

Next, you will create a `tsconfig.json` file, which is where you will define the TypeScript compiler options. This can be done automatically by running the following:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
npx tsc --init --rootDir src --esModuleInterop --resolveJsonModule \
--lib 'es6, dom' --module commonjs --allowJs true --noImplicitAny true
~~~

To learn more about what these options mean, see the [TSConfig Reference doc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig). At this point, you should have the `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory.

Now create an `src` directory where the application code will live. Inside it, create a file called `index.ts`. The `.ts` extension indicates that the file is a TypeScript file:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ mkdir src && touch readme.MD && touch src/index.ts
~~~

In the `index.ts` file, add the following code:

~~~{.js caption="index.js"}
#!/usr/bin/env node

"use strict";
export function adder (one: number, two: number) {
    return one + two
}

export function concatenate (one: string, two: string) {
    return one + two
}


console.log("Hello! Welcome.");

~~~

Ordinarily, TypeScript `.ts` files have to be compiled into `.js` files in order to be executed. Usually, you would use `npx tsc` to compile the code. `tsc` would read the `tsconfig.json` file and apply the configurations while compiling the JavaScript code. But in this tutorial, you will see how to use Bazel instead.

To start using Bazel, install it on your computer. Bazel can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows. To learn how to install it for your platform, use their [installation guide](https://bazel.build/install). Confirm that you have it installed by typing `bazel` in your command line:

<div class="wide">
![Bazel screenshot]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/HuPjlpi.png)
</div>

To define a Bazel project, you need to turn it into a [workspace](https://bazel.build/concepts/build-ref#workspace). A *workspace* is a directory that holds the project's source code and Bazel's build outputs. There are two important files that make this possible: the `WORKSPACE` file and the `BUILD` file.

The `WORKSPACE` file helps Bazel identify a directory as a Bazel project, while the `BUILD` file helps Bazel identify a directory as a [Bazel package](https://bazel.build/concepts/build-ref#packages). A Bazel project can have one or more packages within it, and a package can contain subpackages or subdirectories containing `BUILD` files, thus forming a hierarchy.

Create a `WORKSPACE` file and a `BUILD` file in the `demo_bzl_app` root directory:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
touch WORKSPACE && touch BUILD
~~~

In future projects, you can designate a directory as a Bazel workspace by creating an empty file named `WORKSPACE` in that directory. The `WORKSPACE` file can be empty, but it can also contain instructions for Bazel to download the dependencies needed for the Bazel project.

In your `WORKSPACE` file, add the following code:

~~~{ caption="WORKSPACE"}

load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")
http_archive(
    name = "aspect_rules_ts",
    sha256 = "7d964d57c6e9a54b0ce20f27e5ea84e5b42b6db2148ab7eb18d7110a082380de",
    strip_prefix = "rules_ts-1.2.4",
    url = "https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/releases/download/v1.2.4/rules_ts-v1.2.4.tar.gz",
)

##################
# rules_ts setup #

# Fetches the rules_ts dependencies.
# If you want to have a different version of some dependency,
# you should fetch it *before* calling this.
# Alternatively, you can skip calling this function, so long as you've
# already fetched all the dependencies.
load("@aspect_rules_ts//ts:repositories.bzl", "rules_ts_dependencies")

rules_ts_dependencies(
    # This keeps the TypeScript version in-sync with the editor, \
    which is typically best.
    ts_version_from = "//:package.json",

    # Alternatively, you could pick a specific version, or use
    # load("@aspect_rules_ts//ts:repositories.bzl", "LATEST_VERSION")
    # ts_version = LATEST_VERSION
)

# Fetch and register node, if you haven't already
load("@rules_nodejs//nodejs:repositories.bzl", "DEFAULT_NODE_VERSION", \
"nodejs_register_toolchains")

nodejs_register_toolchains(
    name= "node",
    node_version = DEFAULT_NODE_VERSION,
)

# Register aspect_bazel_lib toolchains;
# If you use npm_translate_lock or npm_import from aspect_rules_js \
you can omit this block.
load("@aspect_bazel_lib//lib:repositories.bzl", \
"register_copy_directory_toolchains", \
"register_copy_to_directory_toolchains")

register_copy_directory_toolchains()

register_copy_to_directory_toolchains()
~~~

A `BUILD` file contains several instructions for Bazel on how to build the package; these instructions are called rules. In the `BUILD` file, add the following rules for building the TypeScript file in `src/index.ts`:

~~~{ caption="WORKSPACE"}
load("@aspect_rules_ts//ts:defs.bzl", "ts_project")

ts_project(
    name="transpile",
    srcs = ["src/index.ts"],
    tsconfig= "//:tsconfig.json",
    allow_js=True,
    resolve_json_module=True
)
~~~

The previous rules in the `BUILD` file tell Bazel the following:

- The rule is named `transpile`.
- The input files that need to be compiled are to be found in the path `src/index.ts`.
- Bazel should fetch the compiler configuration from the `tsconfig.json` file in the current directory, as denoted by `//`.
- `allow_js` is set as `True`, which means that TypeScript should allow JavaScript files to be imported within the `.ts` project files.
- `resolve_json_module` is set as `True`, which means that Bazel should allow the import of `.json` extension files within the `.ts` project files.

To build this package, run the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ bazel build //:transpile
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Screenshot of the `$ bazel build //:transpile` terminal output]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/9bSkkHm.png)
</div>

This will compile the TypeScript file in `src/index.js` to JavaScript files. By now, you should have freshly generated Bazel folders, such as `bazel-bin` and `bazel-out`. These are the folders where Bazel places your build outputs. If you ever need to get rid of them, you can just run `bazel clean` which will delete outputs from your build and reset internal caches.

The output of the previous build can be found in `bazel-bin/src/index.js`, which is a symlink of `bazel-out/darwin-fastbuild/bin/src/index.js`. This is the output of your build, which mirrors the `src` directory in the root folder.

Run the output file by running `bazel-out/darwin-fastbuild/bin/src/index.js`. You should get a `Hello! Welcome.` output in the console.

### Add Tests With Jest

![Add]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/add.png)\

In this tutorial, you'll be using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to add tests to the `demo_bzl_app` project. Start by adding Jest to npm:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
npm install --save-dev jest ts-jest @types/jest
~~~

Next, you need to configure Jest by running the following:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
npx ts-jest config:init
~~~

This will create a `jest.config.js` file, which tells Jest and `ts-jest` how to handle `.ts` files. Also, in your `WORKSPACE` file, you have to load a dependency called [`rules_jest`](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_jest). This is a Bazel library that makes it easier to use Jest with Bazel. Append the following to your `WORKSPACE` file:

~~~{ caption="WORKSPACE"}
http_archive(
    name = "aspect_rules_jest",
    sha256 = "9f327ea58950c88274ea7243419256c74ae29a55399d2f5964eb7686c7a5660d",
    strip_prefix = "rules_jest-0.15.0",
    url = "https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_jest/archive/refs/tags/v0.15.0.tar.gz",
)

####################
# rules_jest setup #
####################
# Fetches the rules_jest dependencies.
load("@aspect_rules_jest//jest:dependencies.bzl", "rules_jest_dependencies")

rules_jest_dependencies()

# Fetches the npm packages for jest-cli.
load("@aspect_rules_jest//jest:repositories.bzl", "jest_repositories")

jest_repositories(name = "jest")

load("@jest//:npm_repositories.bzl", jest_npm_repositories = \
"npm_repositories")

jest_npm_repositories()
~~~

Next, create a test folder and a test file:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
mkdir tests && touch tests/index.test.ts
~~~

In `index.test.ts`, add the following:

~~~{.ts caption="index.test.ts"}
let { adder, concatenate } = require('../src/index.ts');

describe('adder module', () => {
    test('test_adder', ()=> {
        expect(adder(1,2)).toBe(3)
    });
});

describe('concatenate module', () => {
    test('test_concatenate', ()=> {
        expect(concatenate('mary',' had a little lamb'))\
        .toBe('mary had a little lamb')
    });
});
~~~

The code above add test cases for the functions in `src/index.ts`.

You still need to add a way for Bazel to call Jest. In the `BUILD` file, add the following:

~~~{ caption="Bazel.BUILD"}
load("@aspect_rules_jest//jest:defs.bzl", "jest_test")

jest_test(
    name = "test",
    config = "jest.config.js",
    data = [
        "src/index.ts", # the test file below depends on this file
        "tests/index.test.ts",
    ],
)
~~~

`jest_test` is a rule function loaded from the dependencies previously loaded in your Bazel `WORKSPACE` file. It names the rule `test` and tells Bazel where to find the Jest config file. It also lists the test file, `index.tests.ts`, and the file being tested, `index.ts`.

Now you can run your tests with Bazel using the following code:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ bazel run //:test
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Screenshot of the `$ bazel run //:test` terminal output]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/DfTtAcK.png)
</div>

#### Publish to `npm`

To publish this package to npm, you'll first make some changes to the `BUILD` file by adding a new rule. Append the following to your `BUILD` file:

~~~{ caption="Bazel.BUILD"}
load("@aspect_rules_js//npm:defs.bzl", "npm_package")

npm_package(
    name="demo_bzl_app",
    srcs = [":transpile", "readme.md", "package.json"],
    package="demo_bzl_app",
)
~~~

Here, the rule is named `demo_bzl_app`. `srcs` is asking Bazel to use the output files from the `transpile` rule. Remember that the `transpile` rule is the first rule in the `BUILD` file. This makes sure that transpile converts the TypeScript files to `.js` before the package is named. The rule is also asking Bazel to include the `readme.md` and `package.json` files since these will be needed to publish to npm.

Now all you need to do is run the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ bazel build //:demo_bzl_app
~~~

Navigate to the `bazel-out/darwin-fastbuild/bin/` folder. You should see a folder named `demo_bzl_app`, which contains the library's compiled `.js` source files as well as the `readme.md` and the `package.json` files. This is the folder that will be published to npm.

Next, create a `.gitignore` file and add the following to it:

~~~{ caption=".gitignore"}
bazel-*
node_modules
~~~

Then run `git init`, `git add`, and `git commit` to initialize a Git repository, add and commit all relevant files to Git respectively.

Before you can publish your package, you'll need to create an npm account at [https://www.npmjs.com/signup](https://www.npmjs.com/signup). Log into your npm account using `npm login`.

Next, create a file called `publish.sh` and add the following:

~~~{.sh caption="publish.sh"}
#!/bin/bash

echo "Removing old Bazel outputs"
bazel clean

echo "Running tests"
bazel run //:test

echo "Building package"
bazel build //:demo_bzl_app

echo "moving to output dir"
cd bazel-out/darwin-fastbuild/bin/demo_bzl_app

while true; do
    read -p "Are you ready to publish to NPM? " yn
    case $yn in
        [Yy]* ) 
          echo "Now publishing package to NPM";
         npm publish; break;;
        [Nn]* ) exit;;
        * ) echo "Enter yes or no.";;
    esac
done

echo "Done!"

~~~

The previous script will remove old Bazel outputs and then run the tests and build the output files before publishing to npm. Only the `demo_bzl_app` folder will be included in the published package. (`README.md` and `package.json` are included by default.)

Now, you can publish:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ bash publish.sh
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Terminal output of publishing to `npm`]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/aLpK3PG.png)
</div>

You can browse your package on npm. The URL is `https://npmjs.com/package/<your-package-name>`. For this tutorial, it is [https://npmjs.com/package/demo_bzl_app](https://npmjs.com/package/demo_bzl_app). Make sure you increase the version of your release in `package.json` the next time you attempt to publish to avoid getting an error.

## Conclusion

You've now completed a basic build of a TypeScript application with Bazel. You learned how to define a workspace as well as a package. You also learned how to load dependencies, add rules, build, and test a project, and publish to npm, all using Bazel.

Bazel is indeed a powerful and flexible build system that can be used to manage projects of any size and complexity. By leveraging its caching and parallelization features, Bazel can provide significant speed improvements in building and testing large projects.

However, despite all these advantages, Bazel's complex configuration and steep learning curve can sometimes be a hurdle for developers, especially when dealing with large monorepos. This is where Earthly comes into the picture. As a simpler, more intuitive alternative to Bazel, Earthly aims to make building software easier and faster. Our philosophy revolves around simplicity and usability without compromising on performance.

Earthly supports most languages and CI systems, and it also works with monorepos, microservices, and everything in between. So, while you've explored the capabilities of Bazel through this tutorial, you might also want to consider checking out Earthly. It may just be the tool you need to streamline your software building process, irrespective of the scale and complexity of your projects.

Remember, the right tool for your needs will always depend on your specific context, requirements, and constraints. Therefore, knowing your options will only make you more prepared to make the best choices for your software development endeavors. Happy building!

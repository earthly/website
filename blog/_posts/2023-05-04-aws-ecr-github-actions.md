**We're [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/). We make building software simpler and therefore faster. This article is about GitHub Actions, if you'd like to see how Earthly can improve your GitHub Actions builds then [check us out](/earthly-github-actions).**

In this tutorial, we will explore the seamless integration of CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions and Docker deployments with AWS ECR. By leveraging these technologies, you can automate the testing, building, and deployment processes of your applications. GitHub Actions provides a powerful platform for orchestrating development workflows, while Docker offers a consistent and portable environment for packaging and deploying applications. AWS ECR serves as a managed container registry, allowing you to store and retrieve Docker images efficiently. Together, these tools enable streamlined and scalable deployments. Let's get started by creating a GitHub Actions workflow for automating deployments to AWS ECR.

### Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you require the following:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your computer.
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
- Basic knowledge of working with AWS and GitHub.

The code used in this guide is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Rose-stack/nodes-app).

## Setting Up the AWS IAM

To allow GitHub Actions to communicate with AWS, you'll need an [AWS IAM user account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) to manage access to AWS resources. You can achieve it using AWS CLI. It Provides commands for interacting with various AWS services, such as ECR.

To create an IAM user, run the following command in your terminal:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
aws iam create-user --user-name your_username
~~~

Replace `your_username` with your preferred username of choice.

Give the created user access to the AWS Management Console by creating a login profile:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
aws iam create-login-profile --user-name your_username \
--password your_password
~~~

Replace`your_username` with your preferred username and `--password` with your preferred password.

This user requires a user group. In this example, give the user the Admins privilege for simplicity purposes:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
aws iam create-group --group-name your_group_name
~~~

Replace `your_group_name` with your preferred group name such as `Admins`.

Add the above user to the group to IAM:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
aws iam add-user-to-group --user-name your_username \
--group-name your_group_name
~~~

Replace `your_username` with your username and `your_group_name` with the group's name.

To give programmatic access to the user, you will need to create the access keys below:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
aws iam create-access-key --user-name your_username
~~~

Replace `your_username` with your preferred user name.

From above, you will get an output with an `AccessKey` and the `Secret access key`. Copy these keys and save them somewhere. You will require them to send calls to AWS programmatically using GitHub Actions later in this guide.

For the user to be able to programmatically create a deployment to ECR, you will need to add a policy for that and give access to the ECR resources.

To add the policy:

- Login to your AWS Management Console.
- Under IAM > Users, locate the user you created and navigate to it.
- On the permissions tab, click on `Add Inline Policy` as follows:

<div class="wide">
![Image guide]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/9PB8QEH.png)\
</div>

On the resulting page under the JSON tab, paste in the following rules to give full access to `ecr` and `cloudtrail`. This will grant us full access to container images within these services.

<div class="wide">
![Image guide]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/AI7eqgV.png)\
</div>

~~~{.json caption=""}
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:*",
                "cloudtrail:LookupEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "iam:AWSServiceName": [
                        "replication.ecr.amazonaws.com"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
~~~

Review the above policy and enter the name of the policy; create the policy, and it will be added to your user.

## Creating a GitHub Repository

GitHub Actions requires a repository for hosting and sharing the code. It will trigger its workflow based on your current code on a GitHub repository.

This Repository will host a simple sample Node.js application. First, create the application locally as follows:

From your terminal, initialize a Node.js application:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
npm init -y
~~~

Install express to create a simple web server:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
npm install express
~~~

Create an `app.js` to handle the application logic:

~~~{.js caption="app.js"}
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;

app.get('/',(req,res) => {
    res.status(200);
    res.send("Hello World!!");
});

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`App listening on port ${PORT} `));
~~~

Add a script for starting the application on `package.json`:

~~~{.js caption="package.json"}
"start":"node app.js"
~~~

### Creating Application Dockerfile

Docker will use this application and build an image that has the application code and dependencies. GitHub action will then ship the image to ECR. Therefore, you need the correct Docker command for building the application image. On the Node.js application folder, create a `Dockerfile` with instructions for building the Docker image as follows:

~~~{.dockerfile caption="Dockerfile"}
FROM node:16 
# use node 16 image

WORKDIR /usr/src/app # set the working directory

COPY package.json . 
# copy package json to the directory
RUN npm install 
# install the dependencies
COPY . . 
# copy the files

EXPOSE 4000 
# open up port 4000

CMD ["node","app.js"] # cmd command
~~~

Create a `.dockerignore` to ignore the `node_modules` and npm log file on Docker while building the image. This reduces the image size by instructing Docker not to copy any unnecessary files and folders:

~~~{ caption=".dockerignore"}
# .dockerignore
node_modules
npm-debug.log
~~~

Likewise, the code will be pushed to GitHub. Therefore create a `.gitignore` to avoid shipping `node_modules` to GitHub as such:

~~~{ caption=".dockerignore"}
# .dockerignore
node_modules
~~~

Once the application is ready, it's time to use the repository you just created. First, initialize a local GitHub repository:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
git init .
~~~

Add the project files and folders to the repository:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
git add .
~~~

Then commit them using the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
git commit -am "fix: initial commit"
~~~

To publish the code you're the remote repository, add the remote GitHub Repository URL you just created:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
git remote add origin <remote_origin_url>
~~~

Finally, push the code to the online GitHub Repository:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
git push origin <branch_name>
~~~

## Setting Up AWS ECR

You will require an [ECR instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) to store the image we will build and deploy. Navigate to your AWS Management Console, and from the dashboard section, search for `Elastic Container Registry`, then click on **Create a repository**.

<div class="wide">
![Image guide]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/wnC3tR4.png)\
</div>

Ensure you have selected **Private**, enter the name of the repository, and create Repository:

<div class="wide">
![Image guide]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/vWGHWIK.png)\
</div>

## Configure GitHub With AWS ECR

For your workflow to work, you must configure the permissions for GitHub Actions to access ECR. From the project's GitHub repository page, click on Settings. From this page, click on **Secrets and Variables** as follows:

<div class="wide">
![Image guide]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/3nvIsQm.png)\
</div>

Then click on **New Repository Secret** and add the values for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION` (based on your AWS account: For example, us-east-1, ap-south-1, eu-central-1, etc.) as below:

<div class="wide">
![Image guide]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/t10Zyir.png)\
</div>

You should have two keys added as follows:

<div class="wide">
![Image guide]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/AwaxYcD.png)\
</div>

## Writing the Workflow YAML File

The most important part is to create a workflow that will trigger builds and deployments. This will create, connect the pipeline and ensure every process works as expected. Let's discuss how to create a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys our sample Node.js application to ECR.

The first step is to set up is when the workflow should be triggered. In this case, a change to the main branch should always automatically triggers the workflow as follows:

~~~{.yml caption="deploy.yml"}
# deploy.yml
name: Deploy Node.js App to ECR # name

on:
  push: 
   branches: # the branch to be deployed
      - 'main'

jobs:
    build:
        name: Build Image
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Check out code
              uses: actions/checkout@v2
~~~

This will create a name for the workflow and specifies that the workflow should be triggered on a push to the main branch.

The defined job `build` defines the series of steps that should be executed sequentially. Based on the above example, the first step that will be triggered is to check out the code from the repository using the `actions/checkout` action so that the workflows can access it.

Once the workflow has the code repository ready, you can configure AWS credentials programmatically to trigger communication with AWS as follows:

~~~{.yml caption="deploy.yml"}
# deploy.yml
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
  with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
~~~

Note that the above secrets are the keys you added to your GitHub repository secrets. Once the workflow has access to AWS, it can then log in to Amazon ECR and get ready to store the application image as follows:

~~~{.yml caption="deploy.yml"}
# deploy.yml
- name: Login to Amazon ECR
  id: login-ecr
  uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1
~~~

The workflow has now connected all the different stages of the pipeline. It can now trigger the build and deploy the image to ECR. Below is how the GitHub workflow will build, tag, and push the Docker image to Amazon ECR:

~~~{.yml caption="deploy.yml"}
# deploy.yml
- name: Build, tag, and push image to Amazon ECR
  env:
    ECR_REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}
    ECR_REPOSITORY: simple_nodejs_app
    IMAGE_TAG: nodejs_simple_app
  run: |
    docker build -t $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG .
    docker push $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG
~~~

In the above code example, ensure you replace `simple_nodejs_app` with the name of your ECR repository.

To execute the above workflow, on the project's GitHub repository page, navigate to the **Actions** menu and **set up a workflow yourself**:

<div class="wide">
![Image guide]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/7f6mg71.png)\
</div>

### The Final Workflow

Name your workflow `deploy.yml` on the input section, and add your workflow code, ensuring you follow the indentation as follows:

~~~{.yml caption="deploy.yml"}
# deploy.yml
name: Deploy Node js App to ECR # name

on:
  push: 
   branches: # the branch to be deployed
      - 'main'
    
jobs:

    build:
        
        name: Build Image # build name
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest # build os

        steps: # sequence of tasks to be executed

            - name: Check out code 
            # Check the Dockerfile to build the docker image
              uses: actions/checkout@v2
            
            - name: Configure AWS credentials 
            # Programmatic authentication to aws
              uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
              with:
                    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
                    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
                    aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}

            - name: Login to Amazon ECR
              id: login-ecr
              uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1

            - name: Build, tag, and push image to Amazon ECR 
            # copying the code from repo i.e. Dockerfile, versioning 
            # the docker image, and pushing it to ECR.
              env:
                ECR_REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}
                ECR_REPOSITORY: simple_nodejs_app
                IMAGE_TAG: nodejs_simple_app
              run: |
                docker build -t $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG .
                docker push $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG
~~~

## Deploying to AWS ECR

To deploy your workflow, you only need to hit the `Start commit` as follows:

<div class="wide">
![Image guide]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/7vNrG0d.png)\
</div>

Once you have committed, a workflow should be started automatically.

<div class="wide">
![Image guide]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/XBwYXnx.png)\
</div>

Go ahead and refresh your ECR repository, and your application image will be deployed as follows:

<div class="wide">
![Image guide]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/jfi5YV3.png)\
</div>

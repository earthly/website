## WSL2 for `macOS`

I like my mac book pro. It's not an M1, just a 2019 X86 MacBook. But it's Unix based and POSIX compliant. One thing though, it's certainly not Linux. If I want a Linux environment on my laptop, I need a VM.

[Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima) (LInux MAchine) is the simplest way I know of to get that virtual machine. Once it's setup you just type `lima` in a terminal window to be placed in a Linux VM but with all your files and ports available. It's like [WSL2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) but for macOS.

## How It Works

Lima is powered by QEMU and is frequently used (via [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima)) to run containers on macOS. That is, it can be used as an alternative to docker desktop.

## Ubuntu Setup

Let's install it.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> brew install lima
~~~

Check your version:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> limactl --version
~~~

I'm going to install an ubuntu-lts. LTS stands for long term support meaning that there is a longer term commitment to update, patch, and maintain the software.

To see all the possible lima VM templates use ``--list-templates`:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> limactl start --list-templates
~~~

~~~{.bash .merge-code caption=""}
almalinux
alpine
archlinux
buildkit
centos-stream
debian
default

docker-rootful
docker
experimental/9p
experimental/almalinux-9
experimental/apptainer

experimental/rocky-9
faasd
fedora
k3s
k8s
nomad
opensuse
oraclelinux
podman
rocky
singularity
ubuntu-lts
ubuntu
vmnet
~~~

To setup my first VM I use start:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> limactl start --name=default template://ubuntu-lts
~~~

Which installs lts with name `default`.

After that I can jump into my linux shell by typing `lima`:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> uname
  Darwin
> lima
> uname
 Linux
~~~

And much like WSL2 on Windows, I have access to all my macOS files within Lima. One difference, however, is that I can not write to these files.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> lima
> touch file.txt
touch: cannot touch 'file.txt': Read-only file system
~~~

But by default at least, I can write to files under `/tmp/lima`:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> lima
> cd /tmp/lima/
> touch lima.txt
~~~

All of this is configured in the VM template. The Ubuntu-lts templates specifies these like this:

~~~{.yaml caption="Ubuntu-lts.yaml"}
mounts:
- location: "~"
- location: "/tmp/lima"
  writable: true
~~~

## Writable Ubuntu Setup

It's possible to set a folder writeable, and it looks like Rancher (which uses lima under the covers on macOS) uses this configuration so let me try it.

First I stop lima:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> limactl stop default
~~~

Then I edit it:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> limactl edit default
~~~

I only need access to my `sandbox` folder, where I keep all git repos, so I'll edit things to only mount that, but mount it as writable.

~~~{.bash caption="Ubuntu-lts.yaml"}
mounts:
- location: "~/sandbox"
  writable: true 
~~~

Then I can start the VM back up( `limactl start default`) and `lima` into it and write and edit files all I want.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> lima
> echo "hello" > file.txt
> cat file.txt
hello
~~~

It should be noted that lima itself suggests a writable mount like this could be dangerous, but [everyone is doing it](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/discussions/454
).:

~~~{.yaml caption="Ubuntu-lts.yaml"}
  # CAUTION: `writable` SHOULD be false for the home directory.
  # Setting `writable` to true is possible, but untested and dangerous.
~~~

## Conclusion

Lima seems to be a solid choice for a Linux terminal environment on MacOS. Some users have reported slow file system performance, but in my experience, using it in a limited capacity, I haven't encountered such issues. And if you're loving your new Linux set-up on macOS with Lima, consider leveling it up with [Earthly](https://cloud.earthly.dev/login) for a smooth, efficient build process. It's definitely worth checking out!

We're excited to announce that Earthly is participating in Hacktoberfest this October.

Last year's fest saw more than 400,000 pull requests opened and this year should prove to be even larger.

# What is it

The hosting provider DigitalOcean is once again hosting the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) to celebrate open source. The Hacktoberfest invites you to submit pull requests to open source projects. People who submit four or more pull requests, get a free t-shirt from DigitalOcean.

## Sticker Rewards

In addition to this official event, Earthly would also like to kick in some rewards for people who contribute.

Earthly is an open-source build tool. &nbsp;It lets you build everything using containers.

The first 40 participants who submit at least one pull request that is accepted [Earthly's GitHub repo](https://github.com/earthly/earthly) between October 1, 2020 and November 1, 2020, will get an earthly sticker. &nbsp;We have labeled many issues '[hacktoberfest](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest)' to get you started.

You can also qualify for the sticker by adding a working Earthfile file to another opensource project, including your own personal project. &nbsp;Check with the project maintainers first.

## How do I claim my sticker?

Send an email to adam@earthly.com, with your address and link to your merged PRs. We reserve the right to decide whether a PR is contributing value. &nbsp;

## Questions / Help ?

If you have any questions, or if you need any assistance, we are on the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/earthly-room/community) to answer questions. &nbsp;Feel free to also email adam@earthly.dev. &nbsp;

Questions about a specific issue or PR are best left on that issue or PR.

Happy hacking!

**We're [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/). We make building software simpler and therefore faster. Earthly is open-source and written in go. So if you're interested in a simpler way to build then [check us out](/).**

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->
Welcome back. I'm an experienced developer, learning Golang by building an activity tracker. Last time I added SQLite persistence. Today, I'm going to be porting everything to gRPC.

If you're curious about gRPC – how it works, when to use it, what example code might look like – well, you are in luck because I'm going to be building a grpc client, a grpc server, and the protobuf files for my activity tracker. The full code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/adamgordonbell/cloudservices/tree/v4-grpc).

## Why gRPC

If the primary consumer of your service is client-side JavaScript or if your project is going to have many clients, some of which you won't control, then a JSON-based REST service is a great way to go. JSON is human-readable, it's simple to make requests at the command-line or using tools like postman, and it's well understood how to write good REST APIs.

However, it has some downsides. JSON is a text format, so there is more data to send, and it is more expensive to serialize and de-serialize. A standardized API specification exists ( OpenAPI 2.0 aka Swagger 2.0 ) but generating a client and server from the specification is tricky.

gRPC addresses a lot of these issues: it's a binary format, so it's quicker to send. It's faster to serialize and de-serialize, and it has better types than JSON. But, most notably for today, gRPC's `protoc` tool has extensive code-generation abilities. So I can describe my service using .proto files and use an existing tool to do some heavy lifting.

## Protocol Buffers

One of the significant advantages to using gRPC is protocol buffers (protobufs). With protobufs, you can encode the message semantics in a parsable form that the client and the server can share. Also, protobufs are a platform-neutral language for structuring data with built-in fast serialization and support for schema migration, which is vital if you want to change your message formats without introducing downtime. But that's enough talk. Let's start building something.

First thing I'll do is create a message type:

~~~{.protobuf caption="api/v1/activity.proto"}
syntax = "proto3";

package api.v1;

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

message Activity {
    int32 id = 1;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp time = 2;
    string description = 3;
}
~~~

There are a couple of things to note in this short example. First off, I'm using the latest version of the protobuf syntax `proto3`. Second, I'm specifying a package name `package api.v1;` – this will make it easier for me to import the generated code.

Then I'll install the protobuf compiler:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
brew install protobuf
~~~

I'll make sure it's installed:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
protoc --version
~~~

~~~{.bash .merge-code caption="Output"}
libprotoc 3.19.4
~~~

Then I can use it to generate the go struct for the message type:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
 protoc activity-log/api/v1/*.proto \
    --go_out=. \
    --go_opt=paths=source_relative \
    --proto_path=.
~~~

~~~{.bash .merge-code caption="Output"}

Please specify a program using absolute path or make sure the program is available in your PATH system variable
--go_out: protoc-gen-go: Plugin failed with status code 1.
~~~

Oh wait, first, it seems I need protoc-gen-go:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ brew install grpc 
$ go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v1.26
~~~

And I need to add it to my path:

~~~{.bash caption="~/.zshrc"}
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
~~~

With that installed, I can successfully generate some code

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
 protoc activity-log/api/v1/*.proto \
    --go_out=. \
    --go_opt=paths=source_relative \
    --proto_path=.
~~~

And I get an activity struct that I can use in my service and client:

~~~{.go caption="api/v1/activity.pb.go"}
// Code generated by protoc-gen-go. DO NOT EDIT.
// versions:
//  protoc-gen-go v1.26.0
//  protoc        v3.19.4
// source: activity-log/api/v1/activity.proto

package api_v1

import (
 protoreflect "google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect"
 protoimpl "google.golang.org/protobuf/runtime/protoimpl"
 timestamppb "google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/timestamppb"
 reflect "reflect"
 sync "sync"
)

type Activity struct {
 state         protoimpl.MessageState
 sizeCache     protoimpl.SizeCache
 unknownFields protoimpl.UnknownFields

 Id          int32                  `protobuf:"varint,1,opt,name=id,proto3" json:"id,omitempty"`
 Time        *timestamppb.Timestamp `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=time,proto3" json:"time,omitempty"`
 Description string                 `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=description,proto3" json:"description,omitempty"`
}
~~~

`protoc` also generates several helper methods for working with the protobuf message, such as field getters:

~~~{.go caption="api/v1/activity.pb.go"}
func (x *Activity) GetTime() *timestamppb.Timestamp {
 if x != nil {
  return x.Time
 }
 return nil
}

func (x *Activity) GetId() int32 {
 if x != nil {
  return x.Id
 }
 return 0
}
~~~

These are helpful if I want to create an interface to abstract across various message types.

<div class="notice--info">

### Caution: `protoc` and Generated Code

Installing `protoc` via an OS package manager like brew is a quick way to get started but it has some downsides. I'll going to show a better way to generate these files later on in the article.

</div>

Now that I have things working for one message type, I can define my whole service:

~~~{.protobuf caption="api/v1/activity.proto"}
service Activity_Log {
    rpc Insert(Activity) returns (InsertResponse) {}
    rpc Retrieve(RetrieveRequest) returns (Activity) {}
    rpc List(ListRequest) returns (Activities) {}
}

message RetrieveRequest {
    int32 id = 1;
}

message InsertResponse {
    int32 id = 1;
}

message ListRequest {
    int32 offset = 1;
}

message Activities {
    repeated Activity activities = 1;
}

message ActivityQuery {
 int32 offset = 1;
}
~~~

I can then generate the client and the service code using `protoc` again.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
 protoc activity-log/api/v1/*.proto \
    --go-grpc_out=. \
    --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative \
    --proto_path=.
~~~

Running this generates `activity_grpc.pb.go` with all the necessary code for a client and a server.

Note how this time I used `go-grpc_out` and `go-grpc_opt=paths` instead of `go_out` and `go_opt=paths`. I can combine these two to generate messages, the client, and the server.  

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
  protoc activity-log/api/v1/*.proto \
    --go_out=. \
    --go_opt=paths=source_relative \
    --go-grpc_out=. \
    --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative \
    --proto_path=.
~~~

<div class="notice">

### Side Note: OpenAPI Code Generation

Generating code from an API specification is great, especially when different people, or even different teams, are building the client and the server.

People do this less often REST services, but it is doable. In the past, when building REST clients in Scala, I've used OpenAPI specs as the source of truth and generated code from them, so the approach here is not merely limited to gRPC.

A excellent solution for writing REST clients from an OpenAPI definitions is [`gaurdrail`](https://github.com/guardrail-dev/guardrail) if using Scala. In Golang, gRPC is much more common, but [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) looks pretty promising if you want a REST service.

Another possible path to generating a REST client is [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway). If I need rest end-points, in addition to the gRPC end-points, then I may give that a try.[^1]

</div>

## Golang gRPC Server

### Golang Protobuf Types

Now that I've got all my code generated, it's time for me to build the server-side. Let's start at the database layer and work upwards

If you recall from when I was adding the `sqlite` feature, Activities handles all the data persistence. So the data persistence layer shouldn't have change much at all. I just need to make sure I'm using my `protoc` generated struct. I can do this with an import change:

~~~{.diff caption="internal/server/activity.go "}
import 
- api "github.com/adamgordonbell/cloudservices/activity-log"
+ api "github.com/adamgordonbell/cloudservices/activity-log/api/v1"
+ "google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/timestamppb"
~~~

### `google.protobuf.Timestamp`

Previously my Activity struct used `time.Time` to represent time and `net/http` was mapping it back and forth to a JSON string. However, protobufs are typed, so I have chosen to use `google.protobuf.Timestamp` as my time type. This means I don't have to worry about getting an invalid date sent in.

Unfortunately, my generated code now uses a `google.protobuf.Timestamp`, where my persistence layer needs a `time.Time`. This is painless fix with `AsTime`:

~~~{.go caption="timstamp.pb.go"}
// AsTime converts x to a time.Time.
func (x *Timestamp) AsTime() time.Time {
       return time.Unix(int64(x.GetSeconds()), int64(x.GetNanos())).UTC()
}
~~~

<br/>

~~~{.diff captionb="internal/server/activity.go"}
func (c *Activities) Insert(activity *api.Activity) (int, error) {
 res, err := c.db.Exec("INSERT INTO activities VALUES(NULL,?,?);", 
-  activity.Time, 
+  activity.Time.AsTime(), 
  activity.Description)
 if err != nil {
  return 0, err
 }
~~~

And that is the only persistence layer change we need to make to switch from our hand-rolled struct to the `protoc` generated one. Again, you can see the full thing on [github](https://github.com/adamgordonbell/cloudservices/blob/v4-grpc/activity-log/internal/server/activity.go).

### GRPC Service

Now that my persistence layer uses the gRPC messages, I need to create a `grpc.Server` and start it up.

Previously, in my http service, I had an `httpServer`, I'm going to rename that:

~~~{.diff caption="internal/server/server.go"}
- type httpServer struct {
+ type grpcServer struct {
 Activities *Activities
}
~~~

And then I need to make an instance of it:

~~~{.go caption="internal/server/server.go"}
func NewGRPCServer() *grpc.Server {
 var acc *Activities
 var err error
 if acc, err = NewActivities(); err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
 }
 gsrv := grpc.NewServer()
 srv := grpcServer{
  Activities: acc,
 }
 api.RegisterActivity_LogServer(gsrv, &srv)
 return gsrv
}
~~~

And then wire that up to my main method, and I can start things up:

~~~{.go caption="cmd/server/main.go"}
func main() {
 log.Println("Starting listening on port 8080")
 port := ":8080"

 lis, err := net.Listen("tcp", port)
 if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("failed to listen: %v", err)
 }
 log.Printf("Listening on %s", port)
 srv := server.NewGRPCServer()

 if err := srv.Serve(lis); err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("failed to serve: %v", err)
 }
}
~~~

I haven't written an implementation of any of the RPC methods yet, but I'm curious what happens if I run it.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ go run cmd/server/main.go

~~~

~~~{.bash .merge-code caption="Output"}
# github.com/adamgordonbell/cloudservices/activity-log/internal/server
internal/server/server.go:30:39: cannot use &srv (type *grpcServer) as type api_v1.Activity_LogServer in argument to api_v1.RegisterActivity_LogServer:
        *grpcServer does not implement api_v1.Activity_LogServer (missing api_v1.mustEmbedUnimplementedActivity_LogServer method)
~~~

No luck, but it gives me a helpful error message. All I need to do is add an `UnimplementedActivity_LogServer`:

~~~{.diff caption="internal/server/server.go"}
 type grpcServer struct {
+ api.UnimplementedActivity_LogServer
  Activities *Activities
 }
~~~

And with that, I can start running things:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
grpcurl -plaintext -d  '{ "description": "christmas eve bike class" }' \
 localhost:8080 api.v1.Activity_Log/Insert
~~~

~~~{.bash .merge-code caption="Output"}
ERROR:
  Code: Unimplemented
  Message: method Insert not implemented
~~~

How does that work? How can I call the method that I haven't implemented yet? Well, the `protoc` generated code contains `UnimplementedActivity_LogServer`, which looks like this:

~~~{.go captionb="api/v1/activity_grpc.pb.go"}
// UnimplementedActivity_LogServer must be embedded to have forward compatible implementations.
type UnimplementedActivity_LogServer struct {
}
~~~

But, it also implements this interface:

~~~{.go caption="api/v1/activity_grpc.pb.go"}
type Activity_LogServer interface {
 Insert(context.Context, *Activity) (*InsertResponse, error)
 Retrieve(context.Context, *RetrieveRequest) (*Activity, error)
 List(context.Context, *ListRequest) (*Activities, error)
 mustEmbedUnimplementedActivity_LogServer()
}
~~~

and those implementations are what I'm hitting when I call `insert`:

~~~{.go captionb="api/v1/activity_grpc.pb.go"}
func (UnimplementedActivity_LogServer) Insert(context.Context, *Activity) (*InsertResponse, error) {
 return nil, status.Errorf(codes.Unimplemented, "method Insert not implemented")
}
~~~

As a newcomer to GoLang, this is pretty nice! I can just read through the generated code and understand how it works without much difficulty.

<div class="notice--info">

## `grpcurl` Examples: Making gRPC requests by Hand

One potential downside to using gRPC instead of REST is that the messages are less human-readable. Also, the tooling is less standard. With REST, I can make a `GET` request in my browser and view the JSON result, and I can use curl and related tools for more complex requests. This is harder to do with gRPC and protobufs. Or at least it used to be. I've found working with gRPC at the command line is doable once I did a couple of steps:

### 1) Install `grpcurl`

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
brew install grpcurl
~~~

### 2) Enable Reflection

~~~{.diff caption="main.go"}
func main() {
 ...
 srv := server.NewGRPCServer()
+ // Register reflection service on gRPC server.
+ reflection.Register(srv)
 if err := srv.Serve(lis); err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("failed to serve: %v", err)
 }
}
~~~

Then you can make calls against the service like its a REST service:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ grpcurl -plaintext -d  \
  '{ "description": "christmas eve bike class" }' \
  localhost:8080 api.v1.Activity_Log/Insert
~~~

~~~{.bash .merge-code caption="Output"}
{
  "id": 1
}
~~~

And even better, you can introspect against the service and see what gRPC methods it implements:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:8080 describe
~~~

~~~{.protobuf .merge-code caption="Output"}
api.v1.Activity_Log is a service:
service Activity_Log {
  rpc Insert ( .api.v1.Activity ) returns ( .api.v1.InsertResponse );
  rpc List ( .api.v1.ListRequest ) returns ( .api.v1.Activities );
  rpc Retrieve ( .api.v1.RetrieveRequest ) returns ( .api.v1.Activity );
}
~~~

By the way, without reflection you would get an error like this:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:8080 describe
Error: server does not support the reflection API
~~~

But, even with reflection off, you can make specific rpc, calls if you have the `.proto` file

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
 grpcurl -plaintext -d '{ "id": 1 }' \
   -proto ./activity-log/api/v1/activity.proto \
    localhost:8080 api.v1.Activity_Log/Retrieve
~~~

~~~{.bash .merge-code caption="Output"}
{
  "id": 1,
  "time": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "description": "christmas eve bike class"
}
~~~

And if you don't like `grpcurl` then `grpc_cli`, which comes with the gRPC package, also can use the reflection api:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
grpc_cli ls localhost:8080 -l
~~~

~~~{.protobuf .merge-code caption="Output"}
filename: activity-log/api/v1/activity.proto
package: api.v1;
service Activity_Log {
  rpc Insert(api.v1.Activity) returns (api.v1.Activity) {}
  rpc Retrieve(api.v1.RetrieveRequest) returns (api.v1.Activity) {}
  rpc List(api.v1.ListRequest) returns (api.v1.Activities) {}
}
~~~

And you aren't strictly limited to those two options. I like grpcurl because it works like, well curl, but many other options exist. For example, Postman supports gRPC, as does [BloomRPC](https://github.com/bloomrpc/bloomrpc), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) and [many](github.com/gogo/letmegrpc) [command-line](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcui) [tools](https://github.com/gusaul/grpcox).

</div>

### gRPC Service Implementation

So as it stands now, I have completed the database layer, and the service can start up and receive gRPC requests, but there is no service implementation connecting these two parts. Let's write that.

I can follow the provided interface to create my implementation. Insert looks like this:

~~~{.go caption="api/v1/activity_grpc.pb.go"}
Insert(context.Context, *Activity) (*InsertResponse, error)
~~~

And I can implement it by just calling through to my database layer, handling the error conditions, and wrapping the response back up in the expected type:

~~~{.go bcaption="internal/server/server.go"}
func (s *grpcServer) Insert(ctx context.Context, activity *api.Activity) (*api.InsertResponse, error) {
 id, err := s.Activities.Insert(activity)
 if err != nil {
  return nil, fmt.Errorf("Internal Error: %w", err)
 }
 res := api.InsertResponse{Id: int32(id)}
 return &res, nil
}
~~~

I can repeat this for [`List` and `Retrieve`](https://github.com/adamgordonbell/cloudservices/blob/v4-grpc/activity-log/internal/server/server.go), and I have a working solution. (Though the error handling has room for improvement. I'll get back to that later on in the article).

### Testing A gRPC Server

Previously, I had tested my REST service by starting it up in a docker container and exercising some endpoints via a small bash script `test.sh`. I then ran it all in an Earthfile in GitHubActions that looked like this:

~~~{.dockerfile caption="Earthfile"}
test:
    FROM +test-deps
    COPY test.sh .
    WITH DOCKER --load agbell/cloudservices/activityserver=+docker
        RUN  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 agbell/cloudservices/activityserver && \
                ./test.sh
    END
~~~

To get this working with gRPC, all I need to do is change `test.sh` to use `grpcurl`:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
# echo "=== Test Reflection API ==="
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:8080 describe

echo "=== Insert Test Data ==="

grpcurl -plaintext -d  '{ "description": "christmas eve bike class" }' localhost:8080 api.v1.Activity_Log/Insert

echo "=== Test Retrieve Descriptions ==="

grpcurl -plaintext -d '{ "id": 1 }' localhost:8080 api.v1.Activity_Log/Retrieve | grep -q 'christmas eve bike class'

echo "=== Test List ==="

grpcurl -plaintext localhost:8080 api.v1.Activity_Log/List | jq '.activities | length' |  grep -q '1'

echo "Success"
~~~

And additionally, I need to make sure my `+test-deps` container has `grpcurl` installed. There are lots of ways to get `grpcurl` into my alpine base image, but the way I did it was to just copy it from the official grpcurl alpine image into my `test-deps` image:

~~~{.diff caption="Earthfile"}
+ grpcurl:
+    FROM fullstorydev/grpcurl:latest
+    SAVE ARTIFACT /bin/grpcurl ./grpcurl

 test-deps:
     FROM earthly/dind
     RUN apk add curl jq
+    COPY +grpcurl/grpcurl /bin/grpcurl
~~~

And with that, my gRPC server example is working and has end-to-end tests running in CI.

<div class="wide">
{% picture content-wide-nocrop {{site.pimages}}{{page.slug}}/3040.png --alt {{ gRPC Server Example Working }} %}
<figcaption>gRPC Server Example Working</figcaption>
</div>

Now I can move on to the gRPC client example.

## Golang gRPC Client Example

How does the client code get generated? It is generated using `protoc` just like the service. In fact, I've already generated it without realizing it.

`protoc` created the client code when given `--go-grpc_out`:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
    protoc activity-log/api/v1/*.proto \
    --go_out=. \
    --go_opt=paths=source_relative \
    --go-grpc_out=. \
    --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative \
    --proto_path=.
~~~

It looks like this:

~~~{.go caption="api/v1/activity_grpc.pb.go"}
type activity_LogClient struct {
 cc grpc.ClientConnInterface
}

func NewActivity_LogClient(cc grpc.ClientConnInterface) Activity_LogClient {
 return &activity_LogClient{cc}
}
~~~

My Activities client is going to contain an instance of this client:

~~~{.go caption="internal/client/activity.go"}
type Activities struct {
 client api.Activity_LogClient
}
~~~

And I'll initialize the client with an active connection like this:

~~~{.go caption="internal/client/activity.go"}
func NewActivities(URL string) Activities {
 conn, err := grpc.Dial(URL, grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials()))
 if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("did not connect: %v", err)
 }
 client := api.NewActivity_LogClient(conn)
 return Activities{client: client}
}
~~~

Back in my main method, I initialize the client and also create a context. This context lets the client track request-specific details. I'm building mine with a timeout so my service can't hang my client if something goes sideways.

~~~{.go bcaption="cmd/client/main.go"}
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second)
defer cancel()
~~~

<div class="notice--info">

### Breaking the Client

Initially, I ran into some problems getting the client to work. The first time I ran it I got this:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
go run cmd/client/main.go -get 3
Error: Insert failure: rpc error: code = Canceled desc = context canceled
exit status 1
~~~

If you hit this, as the error suggests, you probably called `cancel()` before the response returned.

The next problem I hit was this:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
go run cmd/client/main.go -get 1
Error: Insert failure: rpc error: code = Canceled desc = grpc: the client connection is closing
exit status 1
~~~

The problem was similar: I was closing the connection before the response came back.
</div>

### Golang GRPC Client Implementation

The last step I need to do is call the generated client code and handle any possible errors. Here is the insert:

~~~{.go bcaption="internal/client/activity.go"}
func (c *Activities) Insert(ctx context.Context, activity *api.Activity) (int, error) {
 resp, err := c.client.Insert(ctx, activity)
 if err != nil {
  return 0, fmt.Errorf("Insert failure: %w", err)
 }
 return int(resp.GetId()), nil
}
~~~

Did I say handle errors? That is where things get a little trickier. In a REST service, I can infer meaning from response codes. Insert, shown above, is pretty simple, but I need to differentiate between a server error and an id not existing when implementing `Retrieve`. That was straightforward with Rest: I had 404s and 500s.

It turns out gRPC has something similar.

## gRPC Error Codes

In the gRPC service above, I constructed errors like this:

~~~{.go bcaption="internal/server/server.go"}
func (s *grpcServer) Retrieve(ctx context.Context, req *api.RetrieveRequest) (*api.Activity, error) {
 resp, err := s.Activities.Retrieve(int(req.Id))
 if err == ErrIDNotFound {
  return nil, fmt.Errorf("id was not found %w", err)
 }
 ...
}
~~~

And if I send in an invalid ID, I get a response like this:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ grpcurl -plaintext -d '{ "id": 5 }' \
  localhost:8080 api.v1.Activity_Log/Retrieve 
~~~

~~~{.bash .merge-code caption="Output"}
ERROR:
  Code: Unknown
  Message: id was not found Id not found
~~~

My client can only understand that message by matching on the string. And I don't want my client coupled to the exact strings used by my server.

So, I'm going to change the server to return proper [gRPC status codes](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_statuscodes.html):

~~~{.diff caption="internal/server/server.go"}
package server

import (
+ codes "google.golang.org/grpc/codes"
+ status "google.golang.org/grpc/status"
)
func (s *grpcServer) Retrieve(ctx context.Context, req *api.RetrieveRequest) (*api.Activity, error) {
 resp, err := s.Activities.Retrieve(int(req.Id))
 if err == ErrIDNotFound {
-  return nil, fmt.Errorf("id was not found %w", err)
+  return nil, status.Error(codes.NotFound, "id was not found")
 }
 if err != nil {
-  return nil, fmt.Errorf("Internal Error: %w", err)
+  return nil, status.Error(codes.Internal, err.Error())
 }
 return resp, nil
}
~~~

And then I get proper status codes:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ grpcurl -plaintext -d '{ "id": 5 }' \
  localhost:8080 api.v1.Activity_Log/Retrieve 
~~~

~~~{.bash .merge-code caption="Output"}
ERROR:
  Code: NotFound
  Message: id was not found Id not found
~~~

Then I can unwrap the errors using `status.FromError` on the client-side. This allows me to handle `code.NotFound` separately from other errors:

~~~{.go bcaption="internal/client/activity.go"}
func (c *Activities) Retrieve(ctx context.Context, id int) (*api.Activity, error) {
 resp, err := c.client.Retrieve(ctx, &api.RetrieveRequest{Id: int32(id)})
 if err != nil {
  st, _ := status.FromError(err)
  if st.Code() == codes.NotFound {
   return &api.Activity{}, ErrIDNotFound
  } else {
   return &api.Activity{}, fmt.Errorf("Unexpected Insert failure: %w", err)
  }
 }
 return resp, nil
}
~~~

And with that implementation [in place](https://github.com/adamgordonbell/cloudservices/blob/v4-grpc/activity-client/internal/client/activity.go), the client works. Here is the Earthly build:

## Playing Nice With Others

I mentioned earlier that using an OS package manager installed `protoc` was not necessarily the best way to do things. Now let me show you why:

~~~{.diff caption="api/v1/activity.pb.go"}
 // Code generated by protoc-gen-go. DO NOT EDIT.
 // versions:
-//     protoc-gen-go v1.26.0
-//     protoc        v3.19.4
+//     protoc-gen-go v1.27.1
+//     protoc        v3.13.0
~~~

That was a diff created by running protoc on a Debian environment. And then when I was back on my mac, I got this diff.

~~~{.diff caption="api/v1/activity.pb.go"}
 // Code generated by protoc-gen-go. DO NOT EDIT.
 // versions:
-//     protoc-gen-go v1.27.1
-//     protoc        v3.13.0
+//     protoc-gen-go v1.26.0
+//     protoc        v3.19.4
~~~

The problem is that I'm using different versions of `protoc`. I need a way to pin the version of `protoc` and `protoc-gen-go`. Then I wouldn't have these messy diffs. And this is just a side-project – this will get worse with larger teams.

This is one of the big reasons we see people reach for Earthly. With Earthly, I can add a target that installs a specific version of protoc into a container:

~~~{.dockerfile caption="Earthfile"}
proto-deps:
    FROM golang:buster
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget unzip
    RUN wget -O protoc.zip \
        https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.13.0/protoc-3.13.0-linux-x86_64.zip
    RUN unzip protoc.zip -d /usr/local/
    RUN go get google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go \
               google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
~~~

Then put my code generating `protoc` command in a target as well:

~~~{.dockerfile caption="Earthfile"}
protoc:
    FROM +proto-deps
    WORKDIR /activity-log
    COPY go.mod go.sum ./ 
    COPY api ./api
    RUN protoc api/v1/*.proto \
            --go_out=. \
            --go_opt=paths=source_relative \
            --go-grpc_out=. \
            --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative \
            --proto_path=.
   SAVE ARTIFACT ./api AS LOCAL ./api 
~~~

And then if everyone runs `earthly +protoc` instead of calling `protoc` directly then we will all always get the same output. And an added benefit is it makes on-boarding people to your project easier because they don't have to install any gRPC specific tools locally and you can bump the versions for everyone by just editing the Earthfile.

## Was This Worth It?

The whole gRPC solution is a bit less code than the previous REST solution, if I exclude the generated code. And although it did take me a bit longer to get working, the advantages with this approach should increase as my messages and service endpoints get more complex. Also, I learned a lot, so I think this was a worthwhile change.

Also, [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/) made it simple to test the whole solution and to pin a specific version of the protocol buffer compiler. So, if you are looking for a vendor-neutral way to describe your build and test process, take a look at Earthly, and if you want to read the next installment of this series, sign up for the newsletter.

  Yet another option is to use grpc-web to call grpc end points from client side JavaScript. You can find more out about this on [grpc-web's GitHub page](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web).

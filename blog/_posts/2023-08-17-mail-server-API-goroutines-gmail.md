Harnessing the power of multicore processors is a breeze with Go. In this tutorial, we'll explore concurrency in Go by setting up an efficient mail server. You'll quickly see why concurrency transforms the way we send emails. Let's get started!

## Overview of Concurrent Mail Server

This tutorial guides you through setting up a concurrent mail server for more efficient email sending. You'll also see the perks of using concurrency. Additionally, you'll design an interface where subscribers input details, and users upload documents to send. Before we dive in, let's get a grip on concurrency and goroutines.

## Concurrency and Its Importance

Concurrency allows multiple tasks to be handled at once, boosting performance and minimizing delays. This means:

* Optimized performance
* Efficient use of resources
* Faster server responses
* Greater fault tolerance

In the next sections, I'll clarify the differences and similarities between concurrency and parallelism to clear any confusion.

## Concurrency and Parallelism

> _**Concurrency** simplifies Synchronization; **Concurrency** enables **Parallelism**._
> _**Concurrency** means **dealing** with multiple things at once while **Parallelism** means **doing** multiple things at the same time._
>

<div class="wide">
![concurrent vs parallelism Image]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/eIId6C3.png)
</div>

Concurrency and parallelism, though often used interchangeably, have distinct concepts. Both relate to multiple processes, but their approaches differ.

Concurrency is about managing multiple tasks so they seem to run simultaneously, often achieved through mechanisms like multithreading or multiprocessing. Parallelism, in contrast, is the true simultaneous execution of tasks, possible with hardware like multi-core CPUs.

Grasping these nuances is crucial for effective software design.

## Goroutine and Its Basic Building Block

Goroutines achieve concurrency in Go, lightweight threads and the fundamental organisation unit in **Go**. Goroutines are more cost-effective than traditional threading and execute within the same address space, leveraging multiple dynamic OS threads.

In **Go**,[Goroutines](https://go.dev/tour/concurrency/1) can be simple functions, anonymous functions, or methods. They run concurrently with other tasks, and even the main function is a Goroutine.

To get the most out of Goroutines, you should understand these key components:

* Channels
* Select statement
* Waitgroup
* Mutexes

### Channels

**Channels** allow safe communication between goroutines. There are two types: buffered, which have a set capacity, and unbuffered, which don't.

Here's an example:

~~~{.go caption="channels.go"}
package main

import (
"fmt"
"time"
)


func main() {
// Declare a buffered channel of integers with a capacity of 2.
bufferedChan := make(chan int, 2)

// Unbuffered channel with no capacity
unbufferedChan := make(chan string)
~~~

In the main program, a variable is declared as a **Buffered** channel with a specific capacity, whereas the **Unbuffered** channels do not have a set capacity.

~~~{.go caption="channels.go"}
// Send two integers to the channel.
bufferedChan <- 10
bufferedChan <- 20

// Start a goroutine to receive data from the unbuffered channel.
go func() {
data := <-unbufferedChan
fmt.Println("Received from unbuffered channel:", data)
}()

// Wait for a short period before sending and receiving more data.

time.Sleep(time.Second)

~~~

Values 10 and 20 are sent to a buffered channel using the <- syntax. Meanwhile, an unbuffered channel uses a goroutine to assign received values to a data variable. A brief delay, added via the time package, ensures the goroutine completes before the main function ends:

~~~{.go caption="channels.go"}
// Send some data to the unbuffered channel.
unbufferedChan <- "Hello, Gophers."

// Receive some data from the buffered channel.
data1 := <-bufferedChan
data2 := <-bufferedChan

// Print out the received data.
fmt.Println("Received from buffered channel:", data1, data2)

}

~~~

A string is sent to an unbuffered channel, which requires immediate reception. On the other hand, buffered channels store data in variables (data1 & data2). However, if they exceed their capacity, it results in errors and a potential deadlock.

Here's the full thing:

~~~{.go caption="channels.go"}
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
// Declare a buffered channel of integers with a capacity of 2.
bufferedChan := make(chan int, 2)

// Unbuffered channel with no capacity
unbufferedChan := make(chan string)
// Send two integers to the channel.
bufferedChan <- 10
bufferedChan <- 20

// Start a goroutine to receive data from the unbuffered channel.
go func() {
data := <-unbufferedChan
fmt.Println("Received from unbuffered channel:", data)
}()

// Wait for a short time before sending and receiving more data.
time.Sleep(time.Second)

// Send more data to the buffered channel.
bufferedChan <- 30

// Send some data to the unbuffered channel.
unbufferedChan <- "Hello, Gophers."

// Receive some data from the buffered channel.
data1 := <-bufferedChan
data2 := <-bufferedChan

// Print out the received data.
fmt.Println("Received from buffered channel:", data1, data2)

}

~~~

Output:

<div class="wide">
![channels]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Lla3u9E.png)
</div>

### Select Statement

Go's **select** statement, akin to the `switch`` statement, lets you handle channel data while simultaneously reading from or writing to different goroutines.

Here's an example:

~~~{.go caption="select.go"}
package main

import (
"fmt"
"time"
)

func main() {
// Declare an unbuffered channel of integer and string
intChan := make(chan int)
stringChan := make(chan string)

}
~~~

You create two-channel variables, one with the type "int" and the other with the type "string", both unbuffered.

~~~{.go caption="select.go"}
// Send an integer to the channel.
go func() {
intChan <- 299
}()

// Send a string to the channel.
go func() {
stringChan <- "Hello, Gophers."
}()

~~~

Goroutines create and use channels to send data, like `int` and `string`, simultaneously.

~~~{.go caption="select.go"}
// Receive from the channels in a separate goroutine.
go func() {
select {
case i := <-intChan:
fmt.Println("Received an integer:", i)
case s := <-stringChan:
fmt.Println("Received a string:", s)
}
}()

// Wait for 1 second before ending the program.
time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
~~~

A goroutine waits for data sent through channels. It then executes a case based on which goroutine gets the data first. This goroutine runs with a delay, right before the main program finishes.

Here's the full thing:

~~~{.go caption="select.go"}
package main

import (
"fmt"
"time"
)

func main() {
// Declare an unbuffered channel of integers.
intChan := make(chan int)
stringChan := make(chan string)

// Send an integer to the channel.
go func() {
intChan <- 299
}()

// Send a string to the channel.
go func() {
stringChan <- "Hello, Gophers."
}()

// Receive from the channels in a separate goroutine.
go func() {
select {
case i := <-intChan:
fmt.Println("Received an integer:", i)
case s := <-stringChan:
fmt.Println("Received a string:", s)
}
}()

// Wait for 1 second before ending the program.
time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}
~~~

For a deeper understanding of concurrency, Goroutines, and their building blocks, refer to this [resource](https://earthly.dev/blog/concurrency-in-go/).

## Communicating Sequential Processes(CSP): The Model of Concurrency

Goroutines are built on the theoretical model of [CSP](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/communicating-sequential-processes/)

<div class="wide">
![CSP]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/aZv1TX8.png)
</div>

CSP offers a framework to describe patterns in systems with complex messaging. In Go, concurrency follows CSP principles, emphasizing safety, efficiency, and ease of use with Goroutines. If you want to navigate the challenges of concurrent systems smoothly, CSP is your guide. Up next, we'll draw a surprising connection: relating concurrency and goroutines to the rhythms of the earth and the broader universe.

## Explanation using the Universe: Planet Earth and Human

Think of the universe. It's filled with planets, stars, and moons, all operating at the same time. Take Earth, for instance. Here, countless events like weather patterns, ocean currents, and even our day-to-day activities happen all at once, influencing each other.

Humans are masters of concurrency. We juggle thoughts, feelings, and tasks every day. You might be reading this, thinking about its content, and maybe even listening to musicâ€”all at the same time. Our brains effortlessly handle these simultaneous processes.

In the world of software, concurrency means a program doing multiple things at once, boosting productivity. Just like how our brain multitasks, software benefits from running several tasks simultaneously, getting more done in less time.

## Benefits of Using Goroutines and Gmail Integration

Now that you're up to speed with goroutines, let's dive into their advantages when paired with Gmail Integration for sending newsletter emails.

Benefits of using Goroutines with Gmail Integration:

* Asynchronous, offering great scalability.
* Efficient multitasking during email dispatch.
* Quicker email processing.
* Enhanced experience for users and customers.

Ready to harness the power of goroutines for more tasks? Let's set up your workspace next.

## Setting Up the Environment

Find all the code for this tutorial on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/akinbyte/mail-app).

## Prerequisite Knowledge

Before starting:

* Ensure you have the Go compiler installed. The latest version is Go v1.20.5. If you don't have it, download it from [Go.dev](https://go.dev/dl/). Then we will use these dependencies:

### Essential Packages

* Install the [go-mongodb-driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/). For interaction with MongoDB cloud database and storing user details

* Install [gomail](https://github.com/go-gomail/gomail). For sending emails via an SMTP server for account notifications and communication.

* Install [chi](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-chi/chi/v5). For building HTTP services, initializes middleware, manages request paths, and serves static files.

* Install [godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv). Loads environment variables from a .env file.

* Install [docconv](https://pkg.go.dev/code.sajari.com/docconv). Converts .docx and .doc files to plain text.

But before you install any of these packages, create a new folder and run go mod init:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
go mod init github.com/akinbyte/mailapp
~~~

After `go mod init` command, the project folder will contain `go.mod` file. Add your dependencies to `go.mod`.

## Creating A Gmail Account and Enabling API Access

I'm sure you already have a Gmail account, but you have two options for this project. You can either create a new account and connect it to this project or use your existing one.

To save time, let's assume you've already set up your Gmail account. Now, you need to configure it by enabling 2-Step Verification and allowing access to less secure apps, which is crucial.

When you create a Gmail account, by default, access by third parties is disabled. You'll need to follow specific procedures and configurations to enable access to other third-party apps, like the one you're going to build.
It is essential to configure and set up your account correctly. Please follow the below steps to allow Third-party access to your Gmail account.

i. Sign in to your Gmail account, go to the top right corner, and click on your profile. Then, select "**Manage your Google Account**".
<div class="wide">
![manage-gmail]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/87yWCUG.png)
</div>

ii. Once you've accessed your account page, you can modify settings and make configuration changes. Follow these steps:

* On the left menu, click on the "Security" section.

<div class="wide">
![account-page]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/06J03Wi.png)
</div>

* Scroll down to the bottom and click "**Less secure app**." You can find additional information about less secure apps if needed.

<div class="wide">
![less-secure-app]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/whVgwM6.png)
</div>
<div class="wide">
![less-secure-app-info]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/sABZ3zB.png)
</div>
<div class="wide">
![less-secure-app-info-1]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/9oKJLAQ.png)
</div>
- To enable access for third-party applications like this project, set up **2-Step Verification** in the **Security** section. Make sure to link your devices for verification and choose the appropriate prompts.
<div class="wide">
![verify-code]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/8abWqut.png)
</div>
- Turn on 2-Step Verification by clicking the corresponding option.
<div class="wide">
![2-step-turn-on]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/2irvV0A.png)
</div>
<div class="wide">
![turn-on]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/cVqkPMR.png)
</div>

iii. Once you have enabled the **2-Step Verification**, add an **App Password**.
<div class="wide">
![choose-create-app-password]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/3MP3q0U.png)
</div>

* Choose an app name and device from the dropdown menu, or create a custom name as shown in the image below:

<div class="wide">
![create-app-password]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/sfIOfUz.png)
</div>
- Click on the "Generate" button to create the **App password**.
<div class="wide">
![generate-app-password]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/jqAzM8U.png)
</div>
- Remember to write down or copy the generated App password for future use, as it will only be accessible once generated.

Once you have generated an App password, you can enable API access from other applications. In the next section, you will learn about using environment variables in the application.

## Configuring Credentials and Environment Variables

To ensure the security of your Gmail account integration into the project, you can grant access to less secure apps using the generated App password.
Storing sensitive credentials such as the generated App password and other relevant details, in the `.env` file is recommended. This will help you to minimize security vulnerabilities by keeping credentials in a secure location and using the keys for referencing.

This approach will make it easy to configure and debug your codebase, enhance security, and prevent errors or mistakes during development. Below are the key-value pairs of the environment variable credentials stored in the `.env` file for this project:

~~~
GMAIL_ACC=YOUR_GMAIL_ACCOUNT

APP_PASSWORD=YOUR_APP_PASSWORD

USER_NAME=YOUR_USERNAME
~~~

As you progress, you can continue modifying the .env file by adding new key-value variables required for your application.

## Building the Mail Server API

This section teaches you to build a solid and reliable server-side mail application. But before you proceed, I'll explain the application's structure in the next section for better comprehension.

## Designing the API Architecture

The application structure you will be working with here relies on a diagrammatic representation below, illustrating the application's architecture.

<div class="wide">
![mail-app-arch]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/pXAUWGi.png)
</div>

Soon, you'll grasp the application's structure implemented using Package Oriented Design. Let's begin.

To structure the application for this project, you'll create the following directories (packages) and files. You'll learn about their features and usage.

* `_Main and routes_`: These are the leading root files of the project that use the main package for compilation.

* `_db_`: The _db_ package manages interactions with the **MongoDB** database, including reading and writing queries.

* `_handlers_`: The _handlers_ package contains methods to process user requests.

* `_tools_`: The _tools_ package consists of predefined reusable functions that facilitate user requests.

* `_email_`: The _email_ package is the project's main focus. It includes a function that receives emails through channels using goroutines and another function that sets up the **SMTP** server to send emails.

* `_model_`: The _model_ package contains structs that hold the payload or details received while processing requests.

It's important to note that the output method of the **query** from the **db** package to the **handlers** package implements an `interface` in the `service.go` file in the **db** package, which is the same as the one used in the  **handlers** package to make handlers methods available in the **main** package.

Now that you know the basics of each package's functionality, let's integrate the MongoDB database to store user information and send emails.

Before you proceed, here's a quick explanation of the application's `model`.

## Understanding the Application Model

The `model` package includes the `Subscriber struct`, which holds various fields of type `string` to store the details and `struct` tags of the **subscribers** when they submit their information.

~~~{.go caption="model.go"}
package model

import "time"

// Subscriber: information or details from subscribers
type Subscriber struct {
 FirstName string `bson:"first_name" json:"first_name"`
 LastName  string `bson:"last_name" json:"last_name"`
 Email     string `bson:"email" json:"email"`
 Interest  string `bson:"interest" json:"interest"`
}
~~~

The `MailUpload struct` stores the document uploaded by the user along with their corresponding types and `struct` tags.

~~~{.go caption="model.go"}
// MailUpload - holds the uploaded content and details for the mail
type MailUpload struct {
 DocxName    string    `bson:"docx_name" json:"docx_name"`
 DocxContent string    `bson:"docx" json:"docx"`
 Date        time.Time `bson:"date" json:"date"`
}
~~~

---

The `Mail struct` will be filled with information and seamlessly routed to subscribers via channels.

~~~{.go caption="model.go"}
// Mail: contains the field of what the mail entails
type Mail struct {
 Source      string
 Destination string
 Message     string
 Subject     string
 Name        string
}
~~~

---

### Code Snippet for the model Package

~~~{.go caption="model.go"}
package model

import "time"

// Subscriber: information or details from subscribers
type Subscriber struct {
 FirstName string `bson:"first_name" json:"first_name"`
 LastName  string `bson:"last_name" json:"last_name"`
 Email     string `bson:"email" json:"email"`
 Interest  string `bson:"interest" json:"interest"`
}

// Mail: contains the field of what the mail entails
type Mail struct {
 Source      string
 Destination string
 Message     string
 Subject     string
 Name        string
}

// MailUpload - holds the uploaded content and details for the mail
type MailUpload struct {
 DocxName    string    `bson:"docx_name" json:"docx_name"`
 DocxContent string    `bson:"docx" json:"docx"`
 Date        time.Time `bson:"date" json:"date"`
}

~~~

---

Once you understand this model for this application, you can begin implementing and setting up the MongoDB database.

## Integrating MongoDB Database

As you work on this project, you will be integrating the MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas, a user-friendly cloud database.
Check this [**link**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/) for setup instructions in the **Get Started with Atlas** section, and remember to configure for easy access by changing the IP Address.

You can follow the steps below to set up your database and get the connection string:

* Click on **Database** in the left menu and select **Browse Collection** to create a database for the application.

<div class="wide">
![atlas-dashboard]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/m7pZDFJ.png)
</div>

* Click **Create Database** to add a new database named **mail-app** and include two collections:
**mails** (stores sent mail) and **subscribers** (stores registered subscribers).

<div class="wide">
![create-db]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/rPVJCu7.png)
</div>

* Next, click "Connect" to choose a connection method.

<div class="wide">
![connect-method]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Tayy1Km.png)
</div>

* Select the required MongoDB Driver for **Go** and copy the connection string. Update it with your username and password.
`mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.opv1wfb.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

<div class="wide">
![connect-string]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/gUuJQBk.png)
</div>

* Update the .env file with the URI connection string:

~~~
APP_PASSWORD=YOUR_APP_PASSWORD

GMAIL_ACC=YOUR_GMAIL_ACCOUNT

USER_NAME=YOUR_USERNAME

# hint: URI start with `mongodb+srv://`
URI=<MONGODB_URI>

~~~

Now you can connect to the **mail-app** database using the provided `URI` and have it integrated into your code.

### Setting Up the Database Connection

In this section, you will learn how to connect to the **mail-app** database using the' URI' connection string. This will help to establish a secure and standardized method of accessing and interacting with the database. Let's begin!

Create these **Go** files: `db.go`, `query.go`, `collection.go`, and `service.go` in the _db_ package. In this section and the subsequent one, I will explain the implementation process in each file.

In `db.go`, import the necessary packages and set up the cloud database connection with the `SetConnect` function.

~~~{.go caption="db.go"}
package db

import (
"context"
"log"
"os"
"time"

"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"
"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/options"
)

func SetConnect(uri string) (*mongo.Client, error) {}
~~~

---

The `SetConnect` function sets a `context` timeout with a deadline and cancellation signal, ensuring the database connection process finishes within a specified time limit.

~~~{.go caption="db.go"}
dbCtx, dbCancelCtx := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 100*time.Second)
defer dbCancelCtx()
~~~

Connect the database using the `dbCtx` context and the `URI` string. Check for connection errors.

~~~{.go caption="db.go"}
client, err := mongo.Connect(dbCtx, options.Client().ApplyURI(uri))
if err != nil {
log.Panicln("Error while connecting to database: ", err)
}
~~~

Pinging the database verifies the connection, and the code returns the database client.

~~~{.go caption="db.go"}
if err := client.Ping(dbCtx, nil); err != nil {
log.Fatalln("cannot ping the database: ", err)
}

return client, nil
~~~

In the `db.go` file, the `OpenConnect` function keeps the database connection open to avoid program failure. It returns a `*mongo.Client` pointer, initialises `count` to zero, and sets up an infinite `for` loop.

~~~{.go caption="db.go"}
func OpenConnect() *mongo.Client {
 uri := os.Getenv("URI")
 count := 0
 log.Println("....... Setting up Connection to MongoDB .......")
 for{}
}
~~~

The infinite loop invokes `SetConnect` with the environment variable key `URI` using the `os` package. If there's a connection error, it logs the message for database disconnection and increments `count`. Otherwise, it confirms the database connection and returns the client.

~~~{.go caption="db.go"}
client, err := SetConnect(uri)
if err != nil {
 log.Println("Mail App Database not Connected")
 count++
 } else {
  log.Println("Mail App Database is Connected")
  return client
 }
~~~

In the loop, the code checks the value of `count`. If it exceeds the limit, it logs the error and returns nothing. If the `count` is less than 5, it logs retry information, pauses the program, and continues the connection process.

~~~{.go caption="db.go"}
if count >= 5 {
 log.Println(err)
 return nil
}

log.Println("Wait:.... Mail App Database Retrying to Connect ....")
time.Sleep(10 * time.Second)
continue
~~~

Please note that the `main` function of the program will invoke the `OpenConnect` function to retrieve the `*mongo.Client`. Afterwards, you will learn to access and work with the **mail-app** database and its collections.

### Default Collection Function

The `collection.go` file contains a `Default` function. It takes a `client` parameter of type `*mongo.Client` and a `collectionName` parameter of type `string`. This function returns a pointer to `*mongo.Collection` for accessing the specific **mail-app** database.

~~~{.go caption="collection.go"}
package db

import "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"

func Default(client *mongo.Client, collectionName string)*mongo.Collection{
 return client.Database("mail-app").Collection(collectionName)
}
~~~

To interact with and access the **mail-app** database collections (mails & subscribers) by using this function to write queries for the application.

### Database Queries

You will incorporate the necessary query methods into this section's `query.go` file. These methods must effectively communicate with the **mail-app** database and its collections utilizing the `Mongo struct`.

Import the necessary packages and create a `Mongo struct` type with a `MailDB` field (a `*mongo.Client` pointer type).

Lastly, a `NewMongo` constructor function is defined. It takes a `client` database pointer as a parameter and returns a `DataStore` interface for implementing the queries.

~~~{.go caption="query.go"}
package db

import (
"context"
"fmt"
"log"
"time"

"github.com/akinbyte/mailapp/model"
"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson"
"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson/primitive"
"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"
)

type Mongo struct {
MailDB *mongo.Client
}

func NewMongo(client *mongo.Client) DataStore {
return &Mongo{MailDB: client}
}
~~~

The application utilises three query methods to interact with the **mail-app** database:

* `AddSubscriber`: Adds and stores new subscriber details.
* `AddMail`: Stores the sent mail.
* `FindSubscribers`: Retrieves all registered subscribers.

Below, you will delve into each of these query methods used to interact with the **mail-app** database by examining each defined method in detail. These methods work together to ensure efficient and effective management of data within the **mail-app** database.

Let's begin with the `AddSubscriber` query. This method requires the `subs` argument of type `model.Subscriber` and returns `bool`, `string`, and `error`.

~~~{.go caption="query.go"}
func (mg *Mongo) AddSubscriber(subs model.Subscriber) (bool, string, error) {}
~~~

`AddSuscriber` method above sets a timeout in the `context` for query processing to enable the addition and storage of new subscriber details. The subscriber's `email` is used to check for their existence in the `subscribers` collection of the database while also verifying for errors.

~~~{.go caption="query.go"}
ctx, cancelCtx := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
defer cancelCtx()

var res bson.M
filter :=  {% raw %}bson.D{{Key: "email", Value: subs.Email}}{% endraw %}
err := Default(mg.MailDB, "subscribers").FindOne(ctx, filter).Decode(&res)
~~~

If the error `mongo.ErrNoDocuments` occurs during error checking, indicating no matching document with the email filter, the subscriber details are added to the `subscribers` collection using the `insertOne` method of `mongo.Collection` type with the previously defined `Default` function.

Errors are checked and returned with relevant information. New subscribers are added to the `subscribers` collection without errors, while the function returns that the subscriber is registered already for existing subscribers.

~~~{.go caption="query.go"}
if err != nil {
 if err == mongo.ErrNoDocuments {
  _, err := Default(mg.MailDB, "subscribers").InsertOne(ctx, subs)
  if err != nil {
   return false, "", fmt.Errorf("AddSubscriber: cannot registered this account : %v", err)
  }
 return true, fmt.Sprintf("New Subscriber Added"), nil
 }
 log.Fatalln("AddSubscriber: cannot query database", err.Error())
}
return true, "", nil
~~~

The `AddMail` method stores mail details and content. It takes a parameter `mu` of type `model.MailUpload` and returns a `string` and `error`. This method facilitates efficient mail storage.

~~~
func (mg *Mongo) AddMail(mu model.MailUpload) (string, error) {}
~~~

As it is important for you to set the timeout within the context for a database query to establish a duration within which queries are expected to be completed

It is important, you set the timeout within the `context` for a database query to establish a duration within which queries are expected to be completed. The `mailUpload struct` saves the sent mail and its details in the `mails` collection of the `mail-app` database. When the mail details are successfully added, it returns a `nil` error. However, it returns an error message if there are any issues.

~~~{.go caption="query.go"}
ctx, cancelCtx := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
defer cancelCtx()
//All the uploaded mail to the database
_, err := Default(mg.MailDB, "mails").InsertOne(ctx, mu)
if err != nil {
 return "", fmt.Errorf("AddMail: unable to add new mail, %v", err)
}
return "New mail successfully added", nil
~~~

Finally, the `FindSubscribers` method below retrieves subscriber details without any parameters. It returns a `slice` of type `Primitive.M`, an alias for `map[string]interface{}`, along with a possible `error`.

~~~{.go caption="query.go"}
func (mg *Mongo) FindSubscribers() ([]primitive.M, error) {}
~~~

A `context` timeout is added to process the query within a specified time. The `Find()` method queries the `subscribers` collection without any filter argument passed to it to obtain a `Cursor` that encompasses all the documents in the collection. The result of all the documents is decoded or wrapped in a variable called `res` of type `[]bson.M`. Finally, the `Cursor` is closed using the `defer Cursor.Close(ctx)`. Handled the errors and returned the outcomes of all subscriber's documents.

~~~{.go caption="query.go"}
ctx, cancelCtx := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
defer cancelCtx()

var res []bson.M
//Get all subscriber's data
cursor, err := Default(mg.MailDB, "subscribers").Find(ctx, bson.D{{}})
if err != nil {
 return []bson.M{}, err
}
//decode the result in `res`
if err = cursor.All(ctx, &res); err != nil {
 return []bson.M{}, fmt.Errorf("FindMail: Cannot get all mail: %v", err)
}
defer cursor.Close(ctx)

if err = cursor.Err(); err != nil {
 return []bson.M{}, fmt.Errorf("FindMail: Cursor Error : %v", err)
}
return res, nil
~~~

After completing this step, you've implemented all the required queries for this application. Next, You should have these methods added to an interface.

### Interface Implementation

In this section, your focus is to enhance the security, accessibility and prevent vulnerability of the application by implementing a `DataStore` interface in the `service.go` file created in the **db** package.

This level of abstraction you will be adding, not only improves the maintainability and scalability of the application but also facilitate seamless interaction with the database.

Below, you will have the `Mongo struct` type created in the section above will implicitly implement the `DataStore` interface by providing implementations for all the methods defined in the interface.

~~~{.go caption="service.go"}
package db

import (
"github.com/akinbyte/mailapp/model"
"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson/primitive"
)

type DataStore interface {
 AddSubscriber(subs model.Subscriber) (bool, string, error)
 AddMail(mu model.MailUpload) (string, error)
 FindSubscribers() ([]primitive.M, error)
}
~~~

After importing the necessary packages, the `DataStore` interface is defined, that includes the `AddSubscriber` method for adding new users to the database, the `AddMail` method to store uploaded emails in the database, and the `FindSubscribers` method to retrieve all subscriber details through a database query.

By creating this interface, it is crucial as it will allow you to establish a clear and structured contract that defines the necessary methods or functions for interacting with the underlying database.

You have completed all the tasks to implement in the `db` package. Now, let's create the API endpoints and learn how to handle requests.

## Creating API Endpoints and Handling Requests

Now that you understand integrating the database, it's time to create the API endpoints for handling user requests. Before proceeding, examining the contents in the `tools` package is crucial, as the functions defined within it play a critical role in handling and processing each request.

The following explains the functionalities of the functions within the package:

### Implementing Functions in the Tools Package

First, import all the packages and built-ins needed here.

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
package tools

import (
 "bufio"
 "encoding/json"
 "fmt"
 "html/template"
 "log"
 "net/http"
 "path/filepath"
 "strings"
 "time"

 "code.sajari.com/docconv"
 "github.com/akinbyte/mailapp/model"
)
~~~

The `ReadForm` function below ensures that the subscriber's request body is read safely and efficiently using `http.ParseForm()` to get the request body parameters. If any error comes up while parsing the form, the function prints out the error and returns an empty struct value with the error.

The subs of struct type of `model.Subscribers` fields are populated using the `rq.Form.Get("key")` to get the value associated with the given keys.

If successful, The function returns the filled `subs` struct and a `nil` error message.

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
// ReadForm: This is a reusable function to help read the information or details submitted.
func ReadForm(rq *http.Request, subs model.Subscriber) (model.Subscriber, error) {
 if err := rq.ParseForm; err != nil {
 log.Println(err)
 return model.Subscriber{}, err }
 subs = model.Subscriber{
  FirstName: rq.Form.Get("first_name"),
  LastName:  rq.Form.Get("last_name"),
  Email:     rq.Form.Get("email"),
  Interest:  rq.Form.Get("interest"),
 }
 
 return subs, nil
}
~~~

It would help to use the `JSONWriter` function to write to the server. This function constructs an HTTP response using the parameters `wr` and `interface`. It also takes `msg` as the message to be sent with the response, `statusCode` as the response's status code, and returns an error.

This function sets the HTTP response header to JSON format and adds the status code. It encodes the `msg` value into JSON using `json.Marshal`. Finally, it writes the encoded data to the output response using the `Write` method of `http.ResponseWriter`. Throughout the process, it checks for errors.

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
// JSONWriter: this will help send json response to the client page of this application
func JSONWriter(wr http.ResponseWriter, msg string, statusCode int) error {
  wr.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
  wr.WriteHeader(statusCode)

  b, err := json.Marshal(msg)
  if err != nil {
   return err
  }
  _, err = wr.Write(b)
  if err != nil {
   return err
  }
  return nil
}
~~~

The `ReadMultiForm` function reads and processes a multipart form submitted via an HTTP request. It accepts three parameters: `wr http.ResponseWriter`, `rq *http.Request`, and `mail model.MailUpload`. The function returns a `model.MailUpload` object and an error, if any, for further processing.

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
func ReadMultiForm(wr http.ResponseWriter, rq *http.Request, \
mail model.MailUpload) (model.MailUpload, error) {}
~~~

The function starts by parsing the multipart form data from the HTTP request using the `rq.ParseMultipartForm(10 << 20)` method, which can handle up to 10 megabytes (10MB) of data to ensure correct extraction of the form data. If there are any issues during the parsing process, the code logs the error and terminates the program.

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
if err := rq.ParseMultipartForm(10 << 20); err != nil {
 log.Fatal(err)
}
~~~

Then the function parses the form data and retrieves the `MultipartForm` from the request using the `rq.MultipartForm` property to access the form's fields and files.

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
form := rq.MultipartForm
~~~

Next, the function assigns the form's `docx_name` field value to the `mail.DocxName` variable, capturing the uploaded document's name from the submitted form.

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
mail.DocxName = form.Value["docx_name"][0]
~~~

The function sets the `mail.Date` field to the current time using `time.Now()` to record the timestamp of the form submission.

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
mail.Date = time.Now()
~~~

Using `form.File["docx"]`, the function checks for the existence of the `docx` file within the form, and if it cannot find the file, it returns an error indicating the inability to retrieve the uploaded document.

~~~
file, ok := form.File["docx"]
if !ok {
 return model.MailUpload{}, fmt.Errorf("unable to get uploaded document")
}
~~~

If the file is present, the function verifies the file's extension using `filepath.Ext(file[0].Filename)`. The valid file extension is to access to read using `file[0].Open()`. If any error occurs during the opening, it returns an error indicating the inability to open the document, and the `defer` function closes up the file once it finishes reading.

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
if file[0].Filename != "" {
fileExtension := filepath.Ext(file[0].Filename)

f, err := file[0].Open()
if err != nil {
 return model.MailUpload{}, fmt.Errorf("unable to open uploaded document")
}
defer f.Close()
}
~~~

The `switch-case` statement checks if the uploaded file extension matches the allowed extensions like ".doc", "docx", or ".txt".

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
switch fileExtension {}
~~~

For `case ".txt"`, the function utilises the `bufio.Scanner` function to process the content of the opened file. It reads the file line by line, formats each string with an HTML line break (`<br>`), and appends it to the `mail.DocxContent` variable.

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
scanner := bufio.NewScanner(f)

for scanner.Scan() {
  line := fmt.Sprintf("%s<br>", scanner.Text())
  mail.DocxContent += line
}

if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
 log.Fatal(err)
}
~~~

The code reads all the lines and checks for scanning errors using `scanner.Err()`. Logs and stops the program if an error occurs.

While for that of `case ".docx", ".doc"`, the function utilises a `docconv.ConvertDocx` function to convert an MS Word docx or doc file to text for easy readability. It reads the file line by line, formats each line with an HTML line break (`<br>`), appends it to the `content` variable, and then assigns its value to `mail.DocxContent`.

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
// process .docx or .doc uploaded files
case ".docx", ".doc":
  res, _, err := docconv.ConvertDocx(f)
  if err != nil {
   log.Fatal(err)
  }

  lines := strings.Split(res, "\n")
  var content string
  // Add line breaks to each line
  for _, line := range lines {
   content += line + "<br>"
  }
  mail.DocxContent = content
~~~

If the file extension is not allowed, the function returns an error message stating that only specific file extensions (like ".doc", "docx", or ".txt") are permitted using the `default` condition.

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
default:
  return model.MailUpload{}, fmt.Errorf("upload document not allow; try .txt .docx or .doc")
~~~

Finally, the function returns the `mail` object containing the extracted form information. It also bears a `nil` error value to indicate the successful process.

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
return mail, nil
~~~

The `HTMLRender` function takes three parameters: `wr http.ResponseWriter`, `rq http.Request`, and `dt any` (alias for `interface`). It parses an HTML template file using `template.ParseFiles` and executes it with `wr` and `dt` using the `tmp.Execute` method. If an error occurs while parsing or during execution, the function returns an error message, and a `nil` value indicates successful rendering.

~~~{.go caption="tools.go"}
func HTMLRender(wr http.ResponseWriter, rq *http.Request, dt any) error {
  filePath := "./index.html"

  tmp, err := template.ParseFiles(filePath)
  if err != nil {
   return fmt.Errorf("HTMLRender Error: failed to parse file: %v", err)
  }

  err = tmp.Execute(wr, dt)
  if err != nil {
   return fmt.Errorf("HTMLRender Error: failed to execute template: %v", err)
  }

  return nil
}
~~~

Now that you've understood the functionality implemented in the _tools_ package, let's create the methods for handling HTTP requests.

### Creating Handler Method to Process HTTP

Using the `handlers` package is recommended to handle requests and create endpoints. Implementing the handler methods in the package's `handlers.go` file allows for organized and structured handling and processing of incoming HTTP requests.

Defining an interface in the `service.go` file that encompasses all the handler methods for HTTP requests provides a clear contract for handling these requests. This approach enhances maintainability and scalability, making adding new endpoints or modifying existing ones in the application easier.

Open the `handlers.go` file located in `./mailapp/handlers/handlers.go`  and import all the necessary packages to the file.

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
package handlers

import (
"fmt"
"log"
"net/http"
"time"
"os"

"github.com/akinbyte/mailapp/db"
"github.com/akinbyte/mailapp/model"
"github.com/akinbyte/mailapp/tools"

"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"
)
~~~

The `MailApp struct` contains two fields: `MailDB` of type `db.DataStore`, an interface implementing query methods in the _db_ package, and `MailChan` of type `chan model.Mail` channel to hold mail details to be sent to subscribers.

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
type MailApp struct {
 MailDB db.DataStore
 MailChan chan model.Mail
}
~~~

The `NewMailApp` function below accepts `client *mongo.Client` and `mailchan chan model.Mail` as parameters and returns a `Logic` interface implementing all the handler methods. It serves as a constructor function, enabling modularisation, dependency injection, and asynchronous communication for building the application.

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
func NewMailApp(client *mongo.Client, mailchan chan model.Mail) Logic {
 return &MailApp{
  MailDB: db.NewMongo(client),
  MailChan: mailchan,
 }
}
~~~

The `MailApp struct` has a `Home` method that returns an anonymous function, `http.HandlerFunc`. This function takes `wr http.ResponseWriter` and `rq *http.Request` as parameters. It generates an HTML response for the route using `tools.HTMLRender()` from the _tools_ package. While rendering, any error is logged.

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
func (ma *MailApp) Home() http.HandlerFunc {
 return func(wr http.ResponseWriter, rq *http.Request) {
  err := tools.HTMLRender(wr, rq, nil)
  if err != nil {
   log.Println(err)
   return
  }
 }
}
~~~

---

The following implemented method is `GetSubscriber`. This method handled the registration process of the subscribers after their details had been submitted through a form in a JSON format, and have their details stored in the database.

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
func (ma *MailApp) GetSubscriber() http.HandlerFunc {
 return func(wr http.ResponseWriter, rq *http.Request) {}
}
~~~

---

Declare a variable named `subs` of type `model.Subscriber`.
Call the `tools.ReadForm` function from the _tools_ package to read the HTTP request by passing `wr`, `rq`, and `subs` as arguments. Respond to an error with `http.Error`, including the specified status code and error message.

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
var subs model.Subscriber
subscriber, err := tools.ReadForm(rq, subs)
if err != nil {
 http.Error(wr, fmt.Sprintf("failed to read json : ",err), http.StatusBadRequest)
 return
}
~~~

The `AddSubscriber` method injects dependency through the `db.DataStore` interface. It receives the result of the `ReadForm` function as an argument. The `AddSubscriber` function returns three outputs: `ok` (to verify the successful addition of the subscriber), "msg" (a message to include in the HTTP response), and `err` (to indicate any errors encountered).

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
ok, msg, err := ma.MailDB.AddSubscriber(subscriber)
if err != nil {
 http.Error(wr, msg, http.StatusInternalServerError)
 return
}
~~~

The `switch-case` statement utilises the `tools.JSONWriter` to generate an **HTTP** response by providing reasonable arguments for verifying subscriber registration.

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
switch ok {
 case msg == "":
 tools.JSONWriter(wr, "You have already registered", http.StatusOK)
 case msg != "":
 tools.JSONWriter(wr, msg, http.StatusOK)
}
~~~

The `SendMail` method is the primary handler for processing the HTTP request to send mail to all registered subscribers. I will explain the implementation of this handler step by step.

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
func (ma *MailApp) SendMail() http.HandlerFunc {
 return func(wr http.ResponseWriter, rq *http.Request) {}
}
~~~

To retrieve input details and the uploaded document containing the mail to send, the `tools.ReadMultiForm` function accepts a `mailUpload` variable of type `model.MailUpload` as an argument, along with `wr` and `rq`. `http.Error` to obtain the corresponding HTTP response message and `http.StatusBadRequest` (400) status code.

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
var mailUpload model.MailUpload
upload, err := tools.ReadMultiForm(wr, rq, mailUpload)
if err != nil {
 http.Error(wr, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
 return
}
~~~

The `tools.ReadMultiForm` function returns a value of type `model.MailUpload` and is then passed as an argument to the `AddMail` method, which is part of the `db.DataStore` interface. The purpose is to store the mail intended for subscribers in the database. Following this, an HTTP response with a status code of `http.StatusInternalServerError` (500), accompanied by an appropriate message.

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
msg, err := ma.MailDB.AddMail(upload)
if err != nil {
http.Error(wr, msg, http.StatusInternalServerError)
return
}
~~~

The program logs information, notifies the following process, and pauses for a few milliseconds using the `time` package.

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
log.Println(msg)
log.Println("........ preparing to send mail to subscribers ........ ")
time.Sleep(time.Millisecond)
log.Println("........ Accessing the subscribers Database ........ ")
~~~

The next process calls the `FindSubscribers` method, which returns all registered subscribers in the form of a `[]primitive.M` slice of `map[string]interface{}` named `res`. The process also checks for any return error.

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
res, err := ma.MailDB.FindSubscribers()
if err != nil {
 http.Error(wr, fmt.Sprintf("failed query: %v", err), http.StatusInternalServerError)
 return
}
~~~

Iterate through `res` to access each `map[string]interface{}` containing the database document of registered subscribers.

Assign subscriber details to variables `subEmail`, `firstName`, and `lastName` by extracting them using their respective keys. Fill in the fields of `model.Mail struct` with their corresponding values and assign it to the `mail` variable. Send `mail` through the `MailChan` channel field in the `MailApp struct` to a receiving Goroutine.

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
for _, s := range res {
 subEmail := s["email"].(string)
 firstName := s["first_name"].(string)
 lastName := s["last_name"].(string)
 
 subName := fmt.Sprintf("%s %s", firstName, lastName)
 mail := model.Mail{
  Source: os.Getenv("GMAIL_ACC"),
  Destination: subEmail,
  Name: subName,
  Message: upload.DocxContent,
  Subject: upload.DocxName,
 }
 ma.MailChan <- mail
}
~~~

After successfully sending the mail to the subscriber through an efficient performance channel for processing, the `tool.JSONWriter` generates an HTTP response to the server with the status code `http.StatusOK` (200), confirming the successful delivery of the mail.

~~~{.go caption="handlers.go"}
err = tools.JSONWriter(wr, fmt.Sprintf("Mail Sent %v subscribers", len(res)), http.StatusOK)
if err != nil {
 http.Error(wr, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
 return
}
~~~

Now that you have made significant progress by implementing the handlers method for handling HTTP requests, which includes rendering the home page, registering new subscribers, and sending emails to subscribers.

The next step involves creating a `Logic` interface encompassing all the methods defined in the `handlers` package. And can be achieved by adding the appropriate methods to the `Logic` interface, which will be done in the subsequent section to aid in better understanding.

### Implementing an Interface for Handler Methods

An interface is required to promote code reusability, modularity, and easy maintenance. It allows for interactions of different parts of your program and enables flexibility and interchangeable code usage.

For you to create the interface, open the `service.go` file and implement the `Logic` interface to add all the defined handler methods.

~~~{.go caption="service.go"}
package handlers

import "net/http"

type Logic interface {
 Home() http.HandlerFunc
 GetSubscriber() http.HandlerFunc
 SendMail() http.HandlerFunc
}
~~~

Next, let's create endpoints for these handlers.

### Creating Routes Endpoints (URL)

You can now create endpoints(URL) that typically correspond to a specific function or method in the backend code that handles the request and returns the appropriate response.

The `Routes` function takes in the parameter of `lg handlers.Logic` to access all the handler methods in the `Logic interface` and returns `*chi.Mux` from the `chi` package.

A new HTTP multiplexer `mux` is initialized, which implements the `Router interface` of the `chi` package, then the `Logger` function from the `chi` middleware logs the start and end of each request call and then recovers from panics logs the panic (and a backtrace) using the `Recoverer` function.

~~~{.go caption="routes.go"}
package main
import (
 "github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
 "github.com/go-chi/chi/v5/middleware"
 "github.com/yusuf/mailapp/handlers"
)

func Routes(lg handlers.Logic) *chi.Mux {
 mux := chi.NewRouter()
 mux.Use(middleware.Logger)
 mux.Use(middleware.Recoverer)
}
~~~

Then, the HTTP method `GET` execute the `lg.Home` HandlerFunc attached with the URL `/` route pattern to render the homepage.

Also, there are the `POST` methods with the route pattern of `/api/submit` and `/api/send` to carry out the request for the Subscriber to register and for the user to send mail to their subscribers, respectively.

~~~{.go caption="routes.go"}
mux.Get("/", lg.Home())
mux.Post("/api/submit", lg.GetSubscriber())
mux.Post("/api/send", lg.SendMail())
~~~

The server should serve and handle the static files (CSS and images) required by the application's client side.

To achieve that, `http.Dir` allows access to the **static** directory path `./static` at the root level. This directory is passed as an argument to the `http.FileServer` function, which returns an `http.Handler` assigned to the `fileServer` variable. This `fileServer` serves HTTP requests with the contents of the directory.

~~~{.go caption="routes.go"}
fileServer := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./static"))
~~~

The `Handle` method is invoked to execute the `fileServer` `http.Handler` by stripping off the prefix `/static` of the pattern `/static/*` with the `http.StripPrefix` function. `mux` Pointer to `chi.Mux` is returned to be passed as an argument to the `http.Server`.

~~~{.go caption="routes.go"}
mux.Handle("/static/*", http.StripPrefix("/static", fileServer))
return mux
~~~

The application router to execute all the HTTP requests is now correctly done. It would help if you looked into the next section that shows how the mail server is setup up to receive data from a channel.

## Integrating Gmail API for Sending and Receiving Emails

Using Goroutines to achieve concurrency in sending mail to various people all at once to achieve utmost performance and efficiency is the target goal of this application.

You will learn how to integrate **Google Gmail API** in this program in sending mail, utilising the advantage of goroutine using channels in retrieving data. To get this done, let's get to it.

You can proceed with following the next steps:
  
Create an `email.go` file in the _email_ package. If done, first import the packages needed to implement the functionality of this package.

~~~{.go caption="email.go"}
package email

import (
 "log"
 "os"

 "github.com/akinbyte/mailapp/model"
 "gopkg.in/gomail.v2"
)
~~~

Create a `MailServer` function with a parameter of the `mailChan model.Mail` is the receiving channel object when the user requests to send mail.

~~~{.go caption="email.go"}
func MailServer(mailChan model.Mail) {}
~~~

The `gomail` package initialises a new SMTP Dialer to connect to the SMTP Server. It uses `smtp.gmail.com` as the host and 465 as the port and passes the credentials stored in the `.env` file as arguments to the `gomail.NewDialer` function.

The dial function returns a value that authenticates the user's access to the SMTP Server. It assigns this value to variables `s` and `err` for further processing. Next, it performs error checking, and if any errors are detected, the program panics.

~~~{.go caption="email.go"}
d := gomail.NewDialer("smtp.gmail.com", 465, os.Getenv("GMAIL_ACC"), os.Getenv("APP_PASSWORD"))
s, err := d.Dial()
if err != nil {
 log.Panicf("Error connecting to the Mail Server: ", err)
}
~~~

After the `Dial` function opens a connection to the server, a newly constructed message is now assigned to `msg` utilising the available methods such as `SetHeader`, `SetBody` and `SetAddressHeader` that `gomail.Message struct` implements

~~~{.go caption="email.go"}
msg := gomail.NewMessage()
msg.SetAddressHeader("From", mailChan.Source, os.Getenv("USER_NAME"))
msg.SetHeader("To", mailChan.Destination)
msg.SetHeader("Subject", mailChan.Subject)
msg.SetBody("text/html", mailChan.Message)
~~~

After connecting to the SMTP server and composing the message, the user's authentication access `s` and the composed `msg` are passed as arguments to the `Send` function, delivering the message to the subscriber. The program logs any errors that occur during the sending of the mail.
The `Reset` method maintains the message settings for future messages.

~~~{.go caption="email.go"}
if err := gomail.Send(s, msg); err != nil {
 log.Printf("Mail Sever : %s %v\n", mailChan.Destination, err)
}
msg.Reset()
~~~

The mail server, which helps send the mail to the respective subscriber, is now set up. Let's move on to the function where the mail server will receive the sent mail through a buffered channel.

## Implementing Goroutines and Channels for Concurrency

This application aims to utilise the power of concurrency using goroutines to deliver mail messages to multiple people to enhance efficiency and performance seamlessly.

There are various approaches to achieving synchronisations, using the `sync` or the `atomic` package to accomplish this application's goal: handle mail delivery by processing the mail objects received through the channel.

You will use the custom implementation with the Buffered channel, and I will provide a detailed explanation below.

The function `MailDelivery` uses two parameters, `mailChan` and `worker`, to receive a channel object and determine the number of goroutines (gophers) to generate.

~~~{.go caption="email.go"}
func MailDelivery(mailChan chan model.Mail, worker int) {}
~~~

The function starts by creating a buffered channel called `completionChan` of a boolean type with a capacity equal to the value of the `worker` parameter. This channel enables non-blocking data transmission when the buffer is not complete.

~~~{.go caption="email.go"}
completionChan := make(chan bool, worker)
~~~

A `for` loop generates goroutines (gophers) within the range of the specified number of `workers`. For each of the goroutines, a defined anonymous function helps in processing the mail message received from the `mailChan` that is continuously received using a `range` loop until the channel closes.

Remember that `defer` works in LIFO; It schedules the complete execution of the goroutine for processing the mail message and sends the completion signal to the `completeChan` when the goroutine finishes execution.

~~~{.go caption="email.go"}
for x := 0; x < worker; x += 1 {
  go func() {
   // Signal completion
   defer func() {
    completionChan <- true
   }()
   for m := range mailChan {
    MailServer(m)
    } 
   }()
}
~~~

The program executes another `for` loop with the `worker` variable. This loop receives and discards completion signals from the `completeChan` channel using `<-completeChan`. The `defer` anonymous function manages this process. This loop effectively blocks the main goroutine, ensuring it waits for the completion signal from the `completeChan` channel until all the generated goroutines have finished processing.

~~~{.go caption="email.go"}
for x := 0; x < worker; x += 1 {
 <-completionChan
}
~~~

This function guarantees the completion of all worker goroutines' tasks before returning. The primary function, specifically the main goroutine, calls and executes it.

## Initializing the Application Server in the Main Function

All this while, you must be wondering what the primary function entails or what it does. The `package main` function is the gateway function that helps execute all the code you have implemented. It is the only program recognised by the **Go** compiler.

The Mail Server API representation of the application server shows that the packages created and the code in each lead back to the **main**.

We will cover that next but before we do, update the `.env` file with the `PORT` address or the number of `8080` on which the HTTP server will listen and respond.

~~~
PORT=8080

APP_PASSWORD=YOUR_APP_PASSWORD

GMAIL_ACC=YOUR_GMAIL_ACCOUNT

USER_NAME=YOUR_USERNAME

# hint: URI starts with `mongodb+srv://`
URI=<MONGODB_URI>  
~~~

In the `main` package, import all the needed builtins packages alongside the customs-created packages in the application.

~~~{.go caption="main.go"}
package main

import (
 "context"
 "log"
 "net/http"

 "github.com/akinbyte/mailapp/db"
 "github.com/akinbyte/mailapp/email"
 "github.com/akinbyte/mailapp/handlers"
 "github.com/akinbyte/mailapp/model"
 "github.com/joho/godotenv"
)

Three essential variables are employed: `MailChan`, a channel of type `chan model.Mail` for transmitting mail data between the main goroutine and other goroutines; The `BufferSize` variable specifies the capacity of the buffered channel, and the `Worker` variable handles the number of goroutines to create.

~~~{.go caption="main.go"}
var (
 MailChan   chan model.Mail
 BufferSize int
 Worker    int
)
~~~

In the `main` function, `MailChan` is assigned, allocated, and initialised an object of type `chan model.Mail` with `BufferSize` a buffer capacity using the `make` built-in function. The `Worker` variable is assigned a value of 5.

~~~{.go caption="main.go"}
MailChan = make(chan model.Mail, BufferSize)
Worker = 5
~~~

The `godotenv.Load()` is used to read and access the value of the environment variable in the `.env` files using the key, and if an error occurs, the program `panic` logs the error.
Logs to show the database is about to connect.

~~~{.go caption="main.go"}
err := godotenv.Load()
if err != nil {
 log.Fatal(err)
}

log.Println("Starting the Mail App Server")

log.Println("Preparing Database Connection")
~~~

The application server establishes the database connection by calling the `OpenConnect` function before it starts. The `defer` function closes the link to the database after executing the main goroutine.

~~~{.go caption="main.go"}
client := db.OpenConnect()
defer func(ctx context.Context) {
 err := client.Disconnect(ctx)
 if err != nil {
  return
 }
}(context.TODO())

~~~

The `MailChan` and `Worker` is passed as an argument to the `MailDelivery` function from the `email` package to generate the goroutines, and the `MailChan` is closed once the main goroutine finishes executing.

~~~{.go caption="main.go"}
go email.MailDelivery(MailChan, Worker)
defer close(MailChan)
~~~

The `NewMailApp` function in the `handlers` package initialises the `MailApp struct` by accepting the `client` and `MailChan` as arguments. The `app` variable receives the assignment of the resulting instance.

~~~{.go caption="main.go"}
app := handlers.NewMailApp(client, MailChan)
~~~

The `Routes` function from the `handlers` package receives the `app` variable as an argument. It returns a value of type `*chi.Mux`, which you assign to the `handle` variable. The 'handle' variable initialises the application server on the port address `8080` .

~~~{.go caption="main.go"}
handle := Routes(app)

srv := http.Server{
Addr: fmt.Sprintf(":%s", os.Getenv("PORT")),
Handler: handle,
}
~~~

The application server is started and listens on the port address of `8080`; if an error occurs, the program panics and logs the error.

~~~{.go caption="main.go"}
if err := srv.ListenAndServe(); err != http.ErrServerClosed {
log.Fatalf("Shutting Down the Mail App Server ")
}
~~~

If the server shuts down using `CRTL + C`, the `main` function completes execution, and the program exits.
The implementation and building of a concurrent mail server API has ended and is now ready to be tested.

## Testing the Application API

As you have finished building the mail server API, it is time to test the application. In order to do that, you will need a REST Client API tool such as Postman, Insomnia, or Thunder Client Extension in Vscode. I will be using the **ThunderClient** extension.

To follow along, make sure you have Thunder Client extension or Postman installed and set up the API as described below:

* Create an API collection named **MailAPP**, then add a new request as shown below

<div class="wide">
![create-collection-request]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Z3WSRX7.png)
</div>

* Add a new request for the home page, which you will use to render the application interface later.

<div class="wide">
![home-page-request]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/g7NnLQg.png)
</div>

* Add the HTTP **GET** request method and configure it with the correct URL.

<div class="wide">
![home-request-config]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Z3LeWnd.png)
</div>

* Create and configure new HTTP **POST** requests for subscribers to **subscribe** with their details and **send mail** content of the uploaded document with their URLs.

<div class="wide">
![subscribe-request]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Rr3VKfY.png)
</div>
<div class="wide">
![send-mail]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/7cfPkSR.png)
</div>

Now that you've made configurations for the API. Let's move on to build and run the application to start the local server.

### Starting the API Server

To start the API server, Open your terminal or command prompt and ensure you are in the **mail app** project directory.

Execute this command below to build the application and start up the server.

For Linux or MacOS users (using the wildcard syntax):

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
go run *.go
~~~

For Windows users:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
go run main.go routes.go
~~~

### Testing the Functionalities of the API

In this section, you will test the API's main functions, which include registering new subscribers and sending emails to them. Ensure that the API server is operational and connected to the database. And test each previously created HTTP request individually.

To test each request, click the **send** button to initialize the process. Start by requesting for the subscriber to submit their details.
<div class="wide">
![sub-details]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Xlp8eaA.png)
</div>

Having the same output above would be best, indicating that the request is processed successfully. Now Go ahead and try sending the mail to all the subscribers.
<div class="wide">
![send-email]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/gArrNEQ.png)
</div>

The email sent to all registered subscribers without problems or mistakes indicates success.

To confirm that the registered subscriber received the message, check the email account's inbox below.
<div class="wide">
![inbox-message]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/sB0g9zW.png)
</div>
<div class="wide">
![inbox-content]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Lw1l1hm.png)
</div>
<div class="wide">
![inbox-header]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/J7dsaRY.png)
</div>

## Building User and Subscriber Interface for Mail Sending

Now that it is confirmed that the API is working as expected. You can now build an interface using HTML & CSS and integrate it with the Mail Server API.

## Creating a Mail Details Form and Uploading a Document

Now that you have tested out the functionalities of the API to ensure that it works as intended, meets the requirements, and delivers the expected results, validating its reliability, functionality as well as it performance.

The next step is to make it accessible to users and ensure a seamless user experience. By designing an intuitive interface and making it easy for people to interact. Building a user interface incorporating form inputs for users and subscribers will enable smooth interaction and enhance their overall experience.

It's described below how to create form inputs for the email title and its document, setting the form method to `post` and the encoding method to `multipart/form-data` to handle and process the uploaded document of the mail content by the API and the `**submit**` button to be clicked to submit the form to the URL `/api/send` which triggers an `alert` message.

~~~{.html caption="index.html"}

<!-- Form for a user to upload the mail document to sent -->
      <form action="/api/send" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <label for="">Title</label>
        <div class="user-input">
          <input type="text" name="docx_name" id="name" />
        </div>
        <label for="">Document</label>
        <div class="user-input">
          <input type="file" name="docx" id="" />
        </div>
        <button type="submit" value="" onclick="sendMailAlert()">Send</button>
      </form>
~~~

## Creating a Form for Subscriber Details

Here is a form created for the subscriber to submit their details in the input fields named `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `interest` and have it stored in the database by the API. Also, the `**submit**` button triggers an 'alert' message when clicked to submit the form to this endpoint `/api/submit`.

~~~{.html caption="index.html"}
<form action="/api/submit" method="post">
          <label for="">First Name</label>
          <div class="user-input">
            <input type="text" name="first_name" id="first_name" />
          </div>
          <label for="">Last Name</label>
          <div class="user-input">
            <input type="text" name="last_name" id="last_name" />
          </div>
          <label for="">Email</label>
          <div class="user-input">
            <input type="email" name="email" id="email" />
          </div>
          <label for="">Interest</label>
          <div class="user-input">
            <input type="text" name="interest" id="interest" />
          </div>
          <button type="submit" onclick="submitAlert()">Subscribe</button>
        </form>

## Conclusion

And that's a wrap! In this tutorial, we went on quite a journey building a concurrent mail server from start to finish.

We covered a ton of ground, from grasping concurrency models and Goroutines to creating a MongoDB database and implementing handlers. Then we integrated the Gmail API for seamless email sending and added forms to let users easily upload documents and subscribe.

While there's always room for improvement, this mail server already performs way better than a synchronous alternative. Concurrency works its magic, allowing us to send emails to multiple subscribers simultaneously with Goroutines and channels.

Overall, building this mail server showcased Go's concurrency strengths. Goroutines make easy work of tasks that would be tedious threaded in other languages. And channels provide a clean way to share data between goroutines.

This project lays a solid foundation for a production-ready mail service. Some next steps could be adding email templates, implementing a frontend, and beefing up security. But for now, we have a working concurrent mail server with Goroutines and Gmail integration!

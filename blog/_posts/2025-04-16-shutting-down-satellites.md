**TLDR:**
* In the next three months, we will be phasing out our Earthly Satellite commercial services, including the Earthly Cloud Satellites, Self-Hosted Satellites, and BYOC Satellites, together with their respective free tiers. We are also phasing out Earthly Cloud Secrets and Logs.
* We are also ending active maintenance of the Earthly open-source project.
* We are supporting the community's efforts to self-organize a fork, and we encourage those interested to get involved.

Dear Earthly Community,

I'll start by saying thank you for being here and for helping shape what Earthly is today. Without early adopters like you, there would be no innovation in the world. Our hearts go out to all our community members for believing in us, helping with contributions big or small along the way, and championing Earthly within your organizations.

Today marks the 5-year anniversary of Earthly. Since the launch, we've built a vibrant community of developers who share our vision for a better CI/CD experience. Earthly has been adopted by thousands of teams worldwide, with numerous integrations into diverse CI/CD environments.

From container-centric dev experiences to cache optimization strategies, we've demonstrated tangible improvements in CI speed and efficiencyâ€”providing up to a 10x ROI in compute cost savings and developer productivity. This success is a testament to the creativity and hard work of our community.

We started Earthly to reinvent how CI/CD is done. While CI/CD is central to the developer experience, it is often a source of frustration and inefficiency. We went on a journey to fix these issues and were able to bring massive improvements in both CI consistency via the help of container-centric dev experience - allowing developers to run CI scripts locally - and also in speed - by allowing the cache reuse strategy to be informed by what is actually impacting the current build. These things put together result in a [massive ROI](https://earthly.dev/blog/the-roi-of-fast/) from the CI compute savings perspective (faster builds means more efficient use of compute) and from the developer productivity perspective.

With that said, we have encountered some significant challenges when attempting to commercialize Earthly in its current form, and unfortunately, without commercial success, we are no longer able to sustain our development efforts towards the project.

excerpt: |
    In this article, the author explores why JRuby, an alternative Ruby interpreter that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), is slower than other Ruby runtimes. They discuss the reasons why people use JRuby, the performance trade-offs of running Ruby on the JVM, and provide insights into the performance issues encountered when using JRuby with Jekyll, a static site generator. The author also shares performance advice and updates from the JRuby and TruffleRuby communities.

Recently, I made some contributions to the continuous integration process for Jekyll. Jekyll is a static site generator created by GitHub and written in Ruby, and it uses [Earthly](http://earthly.dev/) and GitHub Actions to test that it works with Ruby 2.5, 2.7, 3.0, and JRuby.

The build times looked like this:

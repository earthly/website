## Backstage

<div class="wide">
![Backstage.io website]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/rqrfMhX.png)
</div>

[Backstage](https://backstage.io/), originally built by [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/), is an open source Kubernetes-based developer platform that's scalable, flexible, and easy to use.

Let's take a look at a few of the reasons Backstage is a popular developer platform.

### Features

One of the main reasons for Backstage's popularity is its [modular architecture](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/architecture-overview). All base functionalities ([Software Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/), [Kubernetes](https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/), [Software Templates](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/), [Backstage Search](https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/), and [TechDocs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/)) are part of the Backstage Core, while additional features can be added later (more on that shortly).

The Software Catalog acts as the inventory for all your services, enabling efficient organization and governance. Backstage's Kubernetes feature is a monitoring dashboard that allows developers to assess the status of their services effortlessly, regardless of the deployment location, be it local or across multiple remote production clusters.

Software Templates automate the scaffolding of new projects, ensuring consistency and best practices, while Backstage Search offers a centralized search across all your documentation and resources, enhancing discoverability. Last but not least, TechDocs integrates documentation directly into the developer portal, allowing for seamless access and maintenance of technical content, streamlining workflows, and boosting productivity within the development lifecycle.

### Flexibility

Backstage boasts notable flexibility through an extensive ecosystem of open source [integrations](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/) and [plugins](https://backstage.io/plugins/). It supports the seamless incorporation of existing tools and services, enabling customization to suit unique workflow requirements. Developers can leverage an array of community-contributed plugins or [create proprietary ones](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/create-a-plugin) to extend Backstage's functionality, ranging from CI/CD, monitoring, and cloud services to security scanning and incident management. Additionally, Spotify recently launched the [Spotify Marketplace for Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com/), which offers enterprise-level and trusted third-party plugins. These paid plugins further improve the aspects of Backstage related to visibility, collaboration, and security.

This adaptability ensures that Backstage can evolve with your tech stack and maintain its role as a comprehensive yet friendly developer interface that provides an incredible developer experience.

### Ease of Use and Developer Experience

Backstage is user-friendly and offers a developer-centric experience that simplifies navigation through a well-organized interface you can explore in the [demo portal](https://demo.backstage.io). Its intuitive design allows you to speed up onboarding, while the standardized setup across tools reduces complexity.

The platform's consistent developer environment and the ability to access various services from a single portal enhance productivity. With features like Software Templates and TechDocs, Backstage empowers developers to focus on innovation rather than getting bogged down by processes and systems.

### Scalability

Backstage is engineered for scalability and caters to both small startups and large enterprises. As discussed, its modular architecture allows you to start small and expand as your needs grow without compromising performance. Additionally, since Backstage runs on Kubernetes, the platform manages an increasing number of services, plugins, and users with ease, maintaining a smooth experience. This, combined with Backstage's ability to integrate with a vast range of tools and services, ensures that as your team and tech stack expand, Backstage can scale with you, facilitating continuous growth and development.

### Support and Documentation

Backstage's robust [documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage/) is a cornerstone of its appeal, guiding users through setup, customization, and development with comprehensive material. Moreover, the [Backstage Community Hub](https://backstage.io/community/) makes it easy to stay tuned to the latest developments and news regarding the platform.

However, for organizations seeking commercial support, Backstage might not be the best fit since neither Spotify nor the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF), which is currently in charge of the project, offer a managed service. Generally, the lack of direct commercial support could be seen as a disadvantage, placing the onus on in-house teams to deploy, maintain, and troubleshoot the platform. That said, the number of [Backstage adopters](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md) continues to grow, including companies as large as American Airlines, Netflix, and Splunk, among others.

## Clutch

<div class="wide">
![Clutch website]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/3qB3q1n.png)
</div>

[Clutch](https://clutch.sh/), born from [Lyft's engineering challenges](https://clutch.sh/docs/about/lyft-case-study/), is a resilient open source platform for infrastructure tooling. Its customizable workflow engine uniquely supports diverse operational tasks, setting it apart with flexibility in managing infrastructure.

Clutch's origin story and adaptability make it a noteworthy solution for dynamic infrastructure needs.

### Features

Clutch is known for its highly secure environment, offering fine-grained [authentication and authorization control](https://clutch.sh/docs/advanced/auth) for resources and comprehensive [security auditing](https://clutch.sh/docs/advanced/security-auditing) for transparency. However, Clutch's real strength lies in its modularity, or—as the Clutch team prefers to call it—the [workflows and components](https://clutch.sh/docs/components) approach.

The frontend is made up of different workflow packages, while the backend uses components named according to their task: services, modules, resolvers, and middleware. As you'll learn soon, this provides great flexibility at the cost of some convenience. Nevertheless, workflows and components allow for seamless integration without the need for messy hacks, supporting both public and private extensions.

Additionally, thanks to its modularity, Clutch simplifies infrastructure management by serving as a single access point to various tech stacks, making complex processes simple.

### Flexibility

Clutch is designed for easy customization and adaptability, thanks to its open and modular [architecture](https://clutch.sh/docs/about/architecture). Teams can craft custom workflow packages with React and backend components using Go. For [custom feature development](https://clutch.sh/docs/development/feature), you create [API definitions](https://clutch.sh/docs/development/api) in Google's [proto3 format](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/). Keep in mind, though, that while Clutch's components are straightforward to tweak and enhance, it lacks a marketplace for plug-and-play integrations. This means that if the current features don't meet your needs, you'll have to actively develop your own solutions.

### Ease of Use and Developer Experience

As is often the case with platforms that favor flexibility and extensibility, [Clutch configuration](https://clutch.sh/docs/configuration) is done via command line arguments. That is, configuring Clutch is done through Protobuf definitions. Similarly, at build time, your team should determine which workflows you want to install and register using Clutch's command line [scaffolding](https://clutch.sh/docs/development/custom-gateway) tool. This means that your comfort using command line tools (in comparison to graphical interfaces) will influence how user-friendly you find Clutch.

### Scalability

At the moment, Clutch does not distribute prebuilt binaries, so you have two options: [build Clutch as a Docker container](https://clutch.sh/docs/getting-started/docker) or run it locally using Go and Node.js. That means that if your goal is to ensure scalability, you can use Clutch's supplied [Dockerfile](https://github.com/lyft/clutch/blob/main/Dockerfile) to build a container with all its core components, or you can build the container from scratch using only the components you want.

Keep in mind that this platform differs significantly from others in this roundup, as it doesn't run natively on Kubernetes. Whether this is a benefit or drawback depends on your specific needs and how you plan to deploy your IDP.

### Support and Documentation

Clutch, like Backstage, is a free, open source platform with a vibrant [community](https://clutch.sh/docs/community). However, unlike Backstage, Clutch lacks commercial support. If you experience issues, you'll have to rely on community channels such as [GitHub](https://github.com/lyft/clutch) or [Slack](https://lyftoss.slack.com/), which may not meet the support needs of many organizations.

## Appvia Wayfinder

<div class="wide">
![Appvia website]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/a7BSBOC.png)
</div>

[Appvia Wayfinder](https://www.appvia.io/) is an IDP that originally addressed the [UK Home Office's complex tech challenges](https://www.appvia.io/customer-stories/home-office). It provides self-service cloud infrastructure for developers and platform teams with robust security, valuable cost management features, and a developer-centric approach.

### Features

Appvia's ecosystem emphasizes a Kubernetes-centric approach to infrastructure management. This means that it aligns closely with Kubernetes methodologies and leverages its capabilities for container orchestration. In this regard, the Appvia ecosystem is akin to [Rancher's](https://www.rancher.com/) in that it provides Kubernetes management at an enterprise level, simplifying Kubernetes as a service.

Appvia's key offerings include [Wayfinder](https://www.appvia.io/wayfinder) for centralized Kubernetes management and [Cloud Landing Zones](https://www.appvia.io/blog/what-is-a-cloud-landing-zone) for establishing secure, compliant, and scalable cloud foundations.

You can think of Wayfinder as a developer self-service platform that simplifies deploying and managing Kubernetes infrastructure and applications. Wayfinder features are provided through [Kubernetes custom resource definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) (CRDs). This can be positive or negative, depending on whether or not you want to build a developer platform following a Kubernetes-centric path. In any case, keep in mind that when installing Wayfinder, it only comes with a [handful of CRDs](https://docs.appvia.io/wayfinder/crd/crd-intro) that provide functionalities for cloud access, networking, cost optimization, DNS management, app management, security, and RBAC policies. To add extra functionality, you must also use CRDs (more on that later).

On the other hand, Appvia's Cloud Landing Zones provide a secure, scalable foundation for cloud operations, incorporating governance, cost controls, and workload isolation to facilitate compliant and efficient cloud adoption and management. You can think of them as opinionated frameworks that provide out-of-the-box access management policies and governance controls, central audits, and compliance. Appvia provides on-request cloud landing zones for major cloud providers like [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) (AWS) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us). You can learn more about Cloud Landing Zones and their architecture in [this blog post](https://www.appvia.io/blog/what-is-a-cloud-landing-zone).

### Flexibility

As mentioned, Wayfinder revolves around a Kubernetes-first approach; for this reason, its flexibility is not as impressive as the other IDPs in this roundup. However, you can expand functionality by creating your own CRD or following the [Kubernetes operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/). For example, you could install the [Jenkins Operator](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/jenkins-operator/) for continuous integration or simply browse [Kubetools](https://collabnix.github.io/kubetools/) to find a tool suitable for your use case. All in all, don't expect an Appvia marketplace for Wayfinder, which can be a drawback for some.

### Ease of Use and Developer Experience

Once you [install Wayfinder on AWS, Azure, or GCP](https://docs.appvia.io/wayfinder/getting-started/prerequisites), your team can interact with it either through its [kubectl-like CLI](https://docs.appvia.io/wayfinder/getting-started/cli), its [API](https://docs.appvia.io/wayfinder/api/wayfinder-api), or the [Wayfinder portal](https://docs.appvia.io/wayfinder/getting-started/portal). This is an advantage since Wayfinder fits with different workflows. Regardless of whether you prefer the UI or the command console, you can manage Wayfinder using abstraction layers and objects similar to those native to Kubernetes.

For instance, Wayfinder uses an abstraction layer called [workspaces](https://docs.appvia.io/wayfinder/workspaces/overview), which groups users and cloud infrastructure so they can be managed independently of other workspaces. This way, you can create [users](https://docs.appvia.io/wayfinder/workspaces/settings/ws-users) in a given workspace and assign them [groups, roles, and access policies](https://docs.appvia.io/wayfinder/workspaces/settings/ws-groups-roles-access-policies) according to the needs of your organization.

Users with sufficient permissions can create [clusters](https://docs.appvia.io/wayfinder/workspaces/ws-clusters) within their workspace and deploy [applications](https://docs.appvia.io/wayfinder/workspaces/applications/application-app) that run on it. Users can also define individually deployable parts of applications, called [components](https://docs.appvia.io/wayfinder/workspaces/applications/application-components). Similar to Kubernetes namespaces, Appvia uses [environments](https://docs.appvia.io/wayfinder/workspaces/applications/application-environment) to isolate groups of resources within a cluster.

Overall, Wayfinder's approach, based mostly on Kubernetes-like concepts rather than services that run on Kubernetes as other IDPs do, is something to keep in mind, given that it can impact the developer experience. That means developers familiar with Kubernetes will feel at home with Wayfinder, while developers with no prior experience may prefer more user-friendly platforms like Backstage, Qovery, or OpsLevel.

### Scalability

There's not much to add about Wayfinder's scalability. Since it runs on Kubernetes, it shares the scalability of other Kubernetes-based IDPs in the roundup. That said, its scalability in terms of functionality and adaptability to your organization's needs is debatable. Wayfinder's backbone is robust thanks to Kubernetes, but the lack of ready-to-use plugins and integrations could be a deal-breaker.

### Support and Documentation

Appvia has numerous resources to help developers. For instance, [Wayfinder's official docs](https://docs.appvia.io/wayfinder) cover how to install Wayfinder, how to install the CLI, how to access the GUI, how to configure SSO and set cloud access, and how to manage DNS. Additionally, the documentation has an API reference and a CRD reference, which can be useful for developing your own solutions. Other resources available include Appvia's [blog](https://www.appvia.io/blog) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@appvia), as well as [e-books](https://www.appvia.io/library/ebooks) and the [Cloud Unplugged podcast](https://podcasts.bcast.fm/cloud-unplugged).

Regarding commercial support, Wayfinder and Appvia Cloud Landing Zones are treated as independent products. [Wayfinder](https://www.appvia.io/pricing/wayfinder) has a free trial, after which you can choose between the Standard plan (support from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays) and the Premium plan (support 24/7). Likewise, [Cloud Landing Zones](https://www.appvia.io/pricing/landing-zone) have a Standard plan (9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday support) and a Premium plan (one-hour response service-level agreement).

## Conclusion

In this article, you learned that Backstage offers versatile yet generalized capabilities that are ideal for organizations looking for a user-friendly and widely known platform. However, maintaining the platform could be a challenge given the lack of commercial support.

Both Qovery and Appvia Wayfinder prioritize governance and security. However, Qovery edges out with superior flexibility and developer experience. OpsLevel, for its part, distinguishes itself by advocating for service ownership, maturity, and standardization alongside an impressive developer experience.

Which developer platform is the best? The answer revolves around what the specific needs of your organization are.

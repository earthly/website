## Outline
- story about werid expressions and stand ups
- working remote
- body language studies
- people as simulators 


I was having trouble with a new report I was developing. The fairly complex SQL that generated it would sometimes be missing a single row and then if a ran things again the row would be back.

I was going to spend the morning tracking this down. That was my standup update for the day. When I gave it I caught a look from someone else on the team. I once saw someone go up to post office box and confidently empty their lunch garbadge into it. I think I made the look then.

I've seen this look, usually is very fleeting, in so many daily stand ups. When you see it don't less it pass by, this facial expression is gold.  Are daily standups valuable?  Maybe. Sometimes they are and sometimes they are not.  

If you are blocked on something then telling the team is great, but really you shouldn't wait for the next standup to share that. There are all kinds of social reasons why a standup is healthy. I work from my home office and have many years and a video stand-up is a great way to actually chat screen to screen, with my teammates. I'm not sure that 'what I did yesterday and what I'm doing today part is as a valuable as made out to be, but the actual off-topic parts of standup. The part where I complain about how difficult it is to get a permit for building a deck and where Alex explains about foraging for mushrooms - those parts I think are really valuable for a distributed team.

When I first started working remote, zoom didn't exist and google hangouts didn't exist. Skype was around but we couldn't use it for our standups. I think there were too many people involved.  So we used a conference call bridge.  I would phone in every day and pace around my apartment as I gave my update and listened to others. 

Now I attend standups via zoom and I sometimes miss that I can't pace around during anymore, but its worth it to see people faces.  See peoples faces it feels like a deeper conversation than with just audio but also I can keep my eye out for that look.

I don't understand how our brains work, but I think we are always running a simulation of things so we can predict what is going to happen next.  My neighbourhg is out watering grass right now -- I can see him out my office window. If his hose wasn't actually on, I'm not sure I would notice I'm not paying that much attention. But if he casually jumped from the ground to the second story roof of his house, it would become the center of my attention

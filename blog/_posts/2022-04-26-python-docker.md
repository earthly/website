Python is a versatile programming language, but running it can be a handful when you have to manage its dependenciesâ€”especially when you are sharing projects with other developers.

One solution is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). The containerization tool runs applications in an isolated system and manages dependencies. It is cost-effective, efficient for CI/CD deployments, scalable, and easy to use, making it a good choice for your Python applications.

This tutorial will show you how to build a Docker container for running a simple Python application. If you'd like to follow along with this project, you can clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/adenicole/dockerpy).

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following for this tutorial:

- [Python 3.9.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Docker 20.10.5](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), using build 55c4c88

## Setting Up the Dockerfile

First, you're going to set up the [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/), which is a sequential set of commands used in building the Docker image. For this, you'll use `pythonunbuffered`, a Python environmental variable that allows the Python output to be sent straight to the terminal when set to a non-empty string or executed with the `-u` option on the command line.

This is useful when log messages are needed in real time. It also prevents issues such as the application crashing without giving relevant details due to the message being "stuck" in a buffer.

Create a project directory and change into the directory using `cd <directory_name>`:

![Change into directory]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/wxt20uT.png)\

Run the commands below to create a virtual environment. This isolates the environment for the Python project, so that it won't affect or be affected by other Python projects running on the local environment. Any dependencies installed won't interfere with other Python projects.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
python3 -m venv <directory_name>
source <directory_name>/bin/activate
~~~

![Creating environment]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/ECOl82C.png)\

Using the following code, create a new file called `Dockerfile` in the empty project directory:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=5000"]
~~~

This code pulls the base image from `python:3.8-slim-buster` and ensures the output is sent straight to the terminal. It confirms the current working directory location, the Python app to be copied to the current directory, and the packages in `requirements.txt` to be installed.

Save and close the file.

## Creating the Python App

Create an `app.py` file and copy the below code:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
 from flask import Flask
 app = Flask(__name__)

 @app.route('/')
 def hello_world():
     return 'Hello, Docker!'
~~~

Save and close. This creates a simple Python web app that shows `Hello, Docker!` text.

Create the `requirements.txt` file. This should contain the dependencies needed for the app to run.

The working directory should now look like this:

![File directory]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/DSHNDNs.png)

Run the following command in the terminal to install the Flask framework needed to run the Python app and add them to the `requirements.txt` file. `pip3 freeze` shows all packages installed via pip.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
pip3 install Flask
pip3 freeze | grep Flask >> requirements.txt
~~~

The `requirements.txt` file should no longer be empty:

```{caption="requirements.txt"}
Flask=2.0.3
pylint
```

Test the app to see if it works by using `python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000` and then navigating to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your preferred browser:

<div class="wide">
![Testing the app]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/y67eloo.png)\
</div>

![And it works!]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/mojDG3X.png)

## Building the Docker Image and Container

Now that the Dockerfile, `requirements.txt`, and `app.py` have been created, you should test the Python app on your local environment to make sure it works.

You're going to build the Docker image from the created Dockerfile. This image is a set of read-only commands used in the building and deployment of Docker containers.

To build the Docker image, use the `docker build --tag dockerpy .` command. It is common practice to use tags; Docker will give the image a default `latest` tag.

You should see something like this:

<div class="wide">
![Docker build]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/M1VgA6z.png)
</div>

Type `docker images` into the terminal to view the newly created image:

![Docker images]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/yDq0xbw.png)\

Tag the image using `docker tag <imageId> <hostname>/<imagename>:<tag>`:

```{.bash caption=">_"}
$ docker tag 8fbb6cdc5e76 adenicole/dockerpy:latest
```

Now that the Docker image has been created and tagged, run the image using `docker run --publish 5000:5000 <imagename>` to build the container:

<div class="wide">
![Building the container]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/amXs8zx.png)
</div>

Then, use `docker ps` to see the list of containers present:

<div class="wide">
![Viewing the list]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/zdMaQrs.png)
</div>

You can now test your application using [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) on your preferred browser. You've run your Python app inside a Docker container.

## Running Docker Push

The container image can be pushed and retrieved from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) registry. Docker Hub is an open source library and community for container images. Pushed images can be shared among teams, customers, and communities. It uses a single command, `docker push <hub-user>/<repo-name>:<tag>`.

To get a hub username, sign up [on the website](https://hub.docker.com/). Then, click **Create Repository** at the top right corner of the page:

<div class="wide">
![Creating repository]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/2FZF5Yi.png)
</div>

Give the repo a name and description, then click **Create**:

<div class="wide">
![Creating a repo]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/siC6S45.png)
</div>

You'll be automatically directed to the page shown below:

<div class="wide">
![Docker push]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Go5YZpk.png)
</div>

Copy the command on the right side of the page to your terminal, replacing `tagname` with a version or with the word `latest`.

In your terminal, run the command `docker login` to connect the remote repository to the local environment. Add your username and password to validate your login, as shown below:

<div class="wide">
![Docker login]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/ichmq9s.png)
</div>

Run the command `docker push <hub-user>/<repo-name>:tagname`:

<div class="wide">
![Pushing image]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/6B3yp4p.png)
</div>

Confirm that your image has been pushed by reloading the Docker Hub page:

![Docker Hub page]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/WaS0pFi.png)

In any terminal, run `docker pull <hub-user>/<repo-name>:latest` to pull the Docker image:

<div class="wide">
![Pulling image]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/oxAMFnY.png)
</div>

## Running Docker Compose

You can now build, run, push, and pull a Docker image. What about building multiple containers? [Docker Compose](/blog/youre-using-docker-compose-wrong) is a tool written in YAML to develop, define, and share multi-container applications on the same host.

Docker Compose is used during:

- **Automated testing environments:** Docker Compose makes it easy for isolated environments to be created and destroyed during tests for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) using simple commands like `docker-compose up -d`.
- **Development environments:** An important aspect of software development is the isolation of environments. Docker Compose creates these environments and enables you to interact with, document, and configure all of the application's service dependencies.

A simple `docker-compose.yml` file looks like this:

~~~{.yml caption="docker-compose.yml"}
version: "3.9"  
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - logvolume01:/var/log
    links:
      - redis
  
 redis:
     image: redis
 volumes:
   logvolume01: {}
~~~

## Using Docker Volumes

Sometimes Docker images and containers are accidentally deleted. [Docker volumes](/blog/docker-volumes) help persist these containers and images to store data, so you don't lose anything in case of accidental deletion.

To show volumes, use `docker volume ls`:

![Showing volumes]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Z5gnFRr.png)

There are currently no volumes on this system. To create a volume in the terminal, run `docker volume create <volumename>` and use `docker volume ls` again to confirm the volume has been created:

![Creating volume]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/6ghNZnI.png)

Using `docker volume inspect <volumename>`, inspect the volume to view important information about it:

![Inspecting volume]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/u8X1OyP.png)

There are currently no containers attached to this volume. Attach the container to the volume using the following:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
docker run -d \
  --name devtest \
  -v <volumename>:/app \
  nginx:latest
~~~

Run `docker inspect devtest` and scroll down to the `"Mounts"` section to confirm if the volume has been attached to the container:

![Volume attached]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/SsIkYMm.png)

## Testing Persistence

Run `docker run -it -v <volumename>:/app ubuntu bash` to run an interactive session with the container using Ubuntu as the base image:

![Running session]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/P8wzxyP.png)

To check the file system, `cd` into the app directory, create a file, and exit:

![Checking file system]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/BAVqiEo.png)

List Docker containers and remove the `dockerpy` container using `docker rm -f <container id>`:

<div class="wide">
![Listing containers]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/4qdxgwU.png)
</div>

```{.bash caption=">_"}
$ docker rm -f 1979
  1979
```

Create another interactive container using the same volume, `cd` into the container app, and view its files. You'll find that the file still exists even though the container was destroyed:

![File persists]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/iZvYSy6.png)

## Conclusion

Using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) gives you a lot of options for your Python applications. As you've seen in this tutorial, you can use Docker to test and store your app and even protect your data in case of accidental deletion. Docker container images are flexible and can be cached to use anywhere.

You can optimize your use of containers even more with [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/), a syntax for repeatable builds. Its automated, self-contained builds make you life easier by improving your workflow.

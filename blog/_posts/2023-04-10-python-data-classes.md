    In this tutorial, you'll learn about Python data classes and how they provide a convenient way to define and manage data-oriented classes. You'll explore the basics of data classes, their differences from regular classes, and how they support type hints, default values, immutability, and more. If you're interested in simplifying your data-oriented classes and improving your Python code, this tutorial is for you!

In Python, classes let you group data and behavior together by defining attributes and methods, respectively. Typically, a class contains both attributes and a set of methods that add functionality. **But what if you have a class that stores a lot of attributes with almost no functionality?** Do you still need to use regular classes, or is there a better alternative?

**Data classes**, first introduced in Python 3.7, provide a convenient way of defining and managing such **data-oriented classes** (who would've guessed!).

**If you already have a Python class that exposes a lot of methods, you don't need a data class**. However, if you're interested in learning about this new feature to manage your data-oriented classes better, then this tutorial is for you.

You'll learn the basics of data classes and how they're different from regular Python classes. In addition, you'll learn how data classes support type hints, default values beyond basic data types, immutability, and more.

Let's get started!

<div class="notice--big--primary">
**📑 Before You Begin**
<br>
To follow along, you need [Python 3.7 or a later version](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed in your preferred development environment. You can find the code examples used here in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/balapriyac/dataclasses-tutorial).
  
This tutorial assumes you're familiar with the working of [Python classes and objects](https://earthly.dev/blog/python-classes-and-objects/).
  
</div>

## Python Classes and Boilerplate Code

You'll first create a regular [Python class](https://earthly.dev/blog/python-classes-and-objects/). In doing so, you'll realize how much boilerplate code you need to write to get a minimal working class. You'll then rewrite the existing Python class as a *data class* to understand how data classes can help you escape the monotony of boilerplate code.

As our goal is to *understand and use* data classes — and not to write fancy classes — let's create a simple class such as a `Student` or an `Employee` class.

So which class do we pick: `Student` or `Employee`?

![student-vs-employee-class]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/5.png)\

I'll choose `Student` class for now. Let's get coding!

### The `__init__` Method

Let's create a `Student` class with the attributes: `name`, `roll_no`, `major`, and `year`. To initialize instances of the `Student` class by passing in values for these attributes in the constructor, you can define the `__init__` method:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_no, major, year):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_no = roll_no
        self.major = major
        self.year = year
~~~

Now that you've created the `Student` class, start a Python REPL, import the `Student` class, and create a student object `jane`:

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> from main import Student
>>> jane = Student('Jane','CS1234','Computer Science','junior')
~~~

You inspect this object `jane` at the REPL:

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> jane
<main.Student object at 0x007EE628>
~~~

As seen, the default representation returned `<main.Student object at 0x007EE628>` is not very helpful; it does *not* contain any information on the attributes of the instance `jane`. If you need a helpful string representation of the object, you should implement the `__repr__` method.

### Adding a Helpful `__repr__`

Let's add a `__repr__` method that returns a string containing the values of the instance attributes:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Student: {self.name} {self.roll_no} {self.major} {self.year}"
~~~

After adding the `__repr__`, the `Student` class should look like this:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_no, major, year):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_no = roll_no
        self.major = major
        self.year = year

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Student: {self.name} {self.roll_no} {self.major} {self.year}"
~~~

Now go back to the REPL and look at the `__repr__` for `jane`:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
>>> jane
Student: Jane CS1234 Computer Science junior
~~~

That's much better!

But remember, *you* added the `__repr__` method. *So it's only as helpful as you choose to make it*. You can as well write a `__repr__` that only returns the string "Student object". Clearly, such a `__repr__` is not more helpful than the default `<main.Student object at 0x007EE628>` (just saying!).

Next, create another instance of the `Student` class `also_jane` with the same values for the instance attributes:

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> also_jane = Student('Jane','CS1234','Computer Science','junior')
~~~

You can verify the equality of the various attributes of `jane` and `also_jane`, like so:

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> jane.name == also_jane.name
True
>>> jane.roll_no == also_jane.roll_no
True
>>> jane.major == also_jane.major
True
>>> jane.year == also_jane.year
True
~~~

**But what happens when you try to compare `jane` and `also_jane`?**

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> jane == also_jane
False
~~~

Well, `jane == also_jane` returns `False`. **Why?**

![why]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/1.png)\

By default, the **==** operator compares the IDs of the two objects. And comparison of objects in terms of attributes doesn't make sense until you implement the `__eq__` method. Okay, let's do that!

### Implementing the `__eq__` Method

For now, we know the following:

- Comparison is valid *only* between two objects belonging to the *same* class.
- The values of the various instance variables of the two objects should be equal.

Let's define the `__eq__` method to compare any two instances of two instances of the `Student` class:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
 def __eq__(self, another):
        if self.__class__ == another.__class__:
            return (self.name, self.roll_no, self.major, self.year) == (
                another.name,
                another.roll_no,
                another.major,
                another.year,
            )
        else:
            return "InvalidComparison"
~~~

<div class="notice--info">
Instead of the "InvalidComparison" string, you can also return `NotImplemented`. If you do so, when you try to compare two objects of different classes, you'll be notified that the `__eq__` method for such comparisons has not been implemented.
</div>

When you try to check if `jane == also_jane` after adding the `__eq__` method, you'll see that it evaluates to `True` as expected:

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> jane == also_jane
True
~~~

To create the `Student` class with *four* attributes, a helpful string representation, and support for object comparison, we have the following in main.py:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_no, major, year):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_no = roll_no
        self.major = major
        self.year = year

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Student: {self.name} {self.roll_no} {self.major} {self.year}"

    def __eq__(self, another):
        if self.__class__ == another.__class__:
            return (self.name, self.roll_no, self.major, self.year) == (
                another.name,
                another.roll_no,
                another.major,
                another.year,
            )
        else:
            return "InvalidComparison"
~~~

Did we work extra hard here? No, we didn't.

(Almost) all of this is boilerplate code that you'll write whenever you create a Python class.

Now suppose you need to add the GPA for each student, remove the `name` attribute and add two new attributes: `first_name` and `last_name`, the list of classes each student has taken, and a bunch more.

**What should you do?**

- You need to first update the `__init__` method. Cool.
- How'll you remember the newly added attributes if you don't add them to the `__repr__`? Okay, so you'll go and modify the `__repr__`.
- Oh wait, you should update the `__eq__` method, too.

Clearly, it's not super fun anymore!

![not-fun]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/notfun.png)\

And as you keep modifying the class, you'll *likely* forget to update one of these. No, I'm not challenging you!

Now let's rewrite the `Student` class as a data class (and see if it'll make things easier for us!). You may delete all the existing code in main.py.

## How to Create Data Classes in Python

To create a data class, you can use the `@dataclass` decorator from Python's built-in `dataclasses` module. You can specify the name of the class and list the fields along with their type annotations as shown:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Student:
    name: str
    roll_no: str
    major: str
    year: str
    gpa: float
~~~

At first look, this version of the `Student` class is easy to read and the type hints indicate the expected data types for each field. There's no `__init__` method or any of the other methods that we added for the regular class. That's it! Your `Student` data class is ready and you can proceed to instantiate objects of this data class.

Now, let's run through the same steps that we did for the regular `Student` class.

Import the `Student` data class and instantiate the student object `jane`:

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> from main import Student
>>> jane = Student('Jane','CS1234','Computer Science','junior',3.98)
~~~

We see that we get a helpful string representation—without implementing a `__repr__()`:

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> jane
Student(name='Jane', roll_no='CS1234', major='Computer Science', year='junior',↩
 gpa=3.98)
~~~

What about comparison of objects? Let's instantiate another `also_jane` and try checking if `jane == also_jane` as before:

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> also_jane = Student('Jane','CS1234','Computer Science','junior',3.98)
>>> jane == also_jane
True
~~~

We see that the comparison returns `True` (as expected). But we did not write the `__eq__` method either.

<div class="notice--big--primary">
### Where Did `__init__` and Other Methods Come From?

To reiterate, we did not write even the class constructor `__init__` method; we only specified the fields and the expected data types as type hints in the data class definition.
  
So where did the `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__` methods come from?

![wondering]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/2.png)\

Well, with data classes, you get a *default implementation* of these methods.
  
You can use built-in functionality from the [`inspect`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html) module to get all the member functions implemented for the `Student` data class:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
from inspect import getmembers,isfunction
from pprint import pprint
...
pprint(getmembers(Student,isfunction))
~~~

~~~{.md caption=""}
[('__eq__', <function __create_fn__.<locals>.__eq__ at 0x014F6A48>),↩
('__init__', <function __create_fn__.<locals>.__init__ at 0x014F6970>),↩
('__repr__', <function __create_fn__.<locals>.__repr__ at 0x014F6A00>)]
~~~

</div>

**To sum up: Python data classes have implementations of the `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__` methods.**

### Create Data Classes With `make_dataclass`

To create a data class, you can also use the `make_dataclass` constructor from the `dataclasses` module:
  
~~~{.python caption=""}
from dataclasses import make_dataclass
Student = make_dataclass('Student',['name','roll_no','major','year','gpa'])
~~~

However, I prefer using the `@dataclass` decorator; the code is a lot easier to read and maintain, especially when there are many fields.

## Type Hints and Default Values in Python Data Classes

We've specified type hints for all the fields in the data class. However, Python is a **dynamically typed language**, so it **does not enforce types** at runtime.

In main.py, let's create an instance of the `Student` data class with invalid types for one or more fields:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Student:
    name: str
    roll_no: str
    major: str
    year: str
    gpa: float

julia = Student('Julia',0.5,'Statistics','sophomore','who cares!')
~~~

Let's zoom into `julia = Student('Julia',0.5,'Statistics','sophomore','who cares!')`:

- The `roll_no` field is expected to be a `str`, but I've set it to 0.5, which is of `float` data type.
- The `gpa` field should be a `float`, but I've set it to the `str` 'who cares!'.

If you (re)run main.py, you'll *not* run into any errors. And if you look at the object `julia` at the REPL, you'll see that `roll_no` and `gpa` have been assigned values 0.5 and 'who cares!', respectively; they're not flagged for invalid data type.

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> julia
Student(name='Julia', roll_no=0.5, major='Statistics', year='sophomore',↩ 
gpa='who cares!')
~~~

So are type hints ~~useless~~ still helpful?

### How Do Type Hints Help?

When you add type hints, the IDE or code editor can be configured to provide *hints* to help you use the right *data types* for the fields.

I'm using VS Code. As you can tell, I set the `roll_no` field to 0.5 even when I was hinted to use a `str`:

<div class="wide">
![type-hints-0]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/th0.png)\
</div>

Similarly, I set the `gpa` field to 'who cares!' while knowing that `gpa` should be a `float`:

<div class="wide">
![type-hints-1]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/th1.png)\
</div>

But why did I do that? Well, only to let you know that the type hints have *no effect at runtime*. But without the type hints, you wouldn't know if you're unintentionally using an incorrect data type.

#### Enforcing Type Checks

If you'd like to enforce types and get errors for mismatched data types, you can use a static type checker like [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). You can install mypy using `pip`:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ pip3 install mypy
~~~

After you've installed mypy, you run type checks by running `mypy script_name` at the terminal:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ mypy main.py
~~~

In main.py, we have the instantiation of `julia` on line 11. mypy flags both Argument 2 (0.5 for `roll_no`) and Argument 5 ('who cares!' for `gpa`) for incompatible type:

~~~{ caption=""}
main.py:11: error: Argument 2 to "Student" has incompatible type "float";↩
 expected "str"  [arg-type]
main.py:11: error: Argument 5 to "Student" has incompatible type "str";↩ 
 expected "float"  [arg-type]
Found 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
~~~

### Setting Default Values for Data Class Attributes

In a regular Python class, you can provide default values for fields in the `__init__()` method definition. Doing so, you can make certain fields optional when instantiating objects.

Data classes give this flexibility, too. However, you should be aware of caveats such as **setting mutable defaults for fields**.

<div class="notice--big--primary">
#### ⚠️ The Curious Case of Mutable Default Arguments in Python

![curious]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/3.png)\
  
Consider the following function `add_to_reading_list`:
  
~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> def add_to_reading_list(item,this_list=[]):
...     if item not in this_list:
...         this_list.append(item)
...     return this_list
...
~~~

It takes in one *required* positional argument `item` and *optionally* a list. When you provide both the item and the list in the function call, the function works as expected, returning a list where `item` is appended to the end of the list:
  
~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> books = ['Deep Work']
>>> new_book = 'Hyperfocus'
>>> add_to_reading_list(new_book,books)
['Deep Work', 'Hyperfocus']
~~~

If you don't have a reading list, you're adding an item to an empty list. So the function `add_to_reading_list` should return a list containing one item, namely, the `item`, yes? Well, that's the behavior you'd expect.
  
However, *default arguments* are bound to the function—only once—at the time of defining the function.
  
Therefore, when you don't pass in the list in the function call, you'll see that the *same* list is modified in each function call. And a new empty list is *not* created for each function call that does *not* contain the list argument:
  
~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> add_to_reading_list('Mindset')
['Mindset']
>>> add_to_reading_list('Grit')
['Mindset', 'Grit']
>>> add_to_reading_list('Flow')
['Mindset', 'Grit', 'Flow']
~~~
  
❗ This is why you should avoid using mutable defaults in Python.
  
</div>

Let's add a `classes` field, a list of classes that a student has signed up for. If a student hasn't signed up for classes as yet, `classes` should be initialized to an empty list. But setting `classes` to the literal [], as shown here, won't work.  

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Student:
    name: str
    roll_no: str
    major: str
    year: str
    gpa: float
    classes: list = []
~~~

Luckily, data classes *do not* allow you to define mutable defaults such as lists and dictionaries. And you'll get a `ValueError`:

~~~{ caption="Output"}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 3, in <module>
    class Student:
    …
  ValueError: mutable default <class 'list'> for field classes is not allowed:↩
   use default_factory
~~~

The above traceback provides helpful information on *what* needs to be fixed and *how* you can fix it:

- **The problem**: Mutable default
- **The solution**: Use `default_factory`

The `field()` function in the `dataclasses` module lets you set default values, exclude certain fields from comparison, string representation, and more.
One of the options the `field()` function takes is `default_factory`, which is any Python callable that's called every time a new instance is created.

So we can set `default_factory` to `list`. I've also set `compare = False` to exclude the `classses` field from comparison:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
from dataclasses import dataclass,field

@dataclass
class Student:
    name: str
    roll_no: str
    major: str
    year: str
    gpa: float
    classes: list = field(default_factory=list,compare=False)
~~~

Now that we've set `default_factory` to the callable `list`, a new empty list is created—every time an instance of `Student` data class is created—to set the default value for the `classes` field.

We pass in the `classes` list when instantiating `julia` and do not pass in for `jane`:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
...
julia = Student('Julia',0.5,'Statistics','sophomore','who cares!',['Statistics↩
 101','Graph theory','Real analysis'])
print(julia)
jane = Student('Jane','CS1234','Computer Science','junior',3.98)
print(jane)
~~~

In the output, we see that the provided and default (empty) lists are used for `julia` and `jane`, respectively:

~~~{ caption="Output"}

Student(name='Julia', roll_no=0.5, major='Statistics', year='sophomore',↩
 gpa='who cares!', classes=['Statistics 101', 'Graph theory', 'Real analysis'])
Student(name='Jane', roll_no='CS1234', major='Computer Science', year='junior',↩
 gpa=3.98, classes=[])
~~~

<div class="notice--info">
#### ⚠️ Specify Default Fields After Non-Default Fields
<br>
As with arguments in a function call, data classes should include the fields *without* default values first, followed by the ones *with* default values.
  
Here's an example. `Coordinate3D` is a data class that stores the location of a point (x,y,z) in 3D space:  

~~~{.python caption="point3d.py"}
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Coordinate3D:
    x: float
    y: float
    z: float
~~~

Suppose you'd like the point to be the origin when *none* of the coordinates `x`, `y`, and `z` are mentioned when creating an instance. For this to happen, we set 0.0 as the default value of all the three coordinates `x`, `y`, and `z`:

~~~{.python caption="point3d.py"}
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Coordinate3D:
    x: float = 0.0
    y: float = 0.0
    z: float = 0.0


origin = Coordinate3D()
print(origin)
~~~
  
And it works as expected; `origin` is (0.0,0.0,0.0):
  
~~~{.md caption="Output"}
Coordinate3D(x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0)
~~~
  
Suppose we want the point to lie in the YZ-plane (where x = 0) when the `x` coordinate is not specified. We don't need defaults for `y` and `z`, but now `x` takes a default value of 0.0:

![coordinate]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/xyzplane.png)\

If you do the following, you'll run into an error:

~~~{.python caption="point3d.py"}
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Coordinate3D:
    x: float = 0.0
    y: float
    z: float 

origin = Coordinate3D()
print(origin)
~~~
  
The error is due to `y`, a non-default field, following `x`, a field with default value:
  
~~~{.md caption="Output"}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 4, in <module>
    class Coordinate3D:
    ...
  TypeError: non-default argument 'y' follows default argument
~~~

To fix the error, simply move `x` as the last field in the class definition:
  
~~~{.python caption="point3d.py"}
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Coordinate3D:
    y: float
    z: float
    x: float = 0.0


point_yz = Coordinate3D(1.5,3)
print(point_yz)
~~~
  
Now we don't run into errors and the default value of 0.0 has been used for `x`:
  
~~~{.md caption="Output"}
Coordinate3D(y=1.5, z=3, x=0.0)
~~~

</div>

## Are Immutable Data Classes Helpful?

By default, all data class instances are **mutable**. Meaning you *can* modify the values of one or more fields after the instance is initialized.

Let's update the `gpa` field of `julia` to 3.33 (a valid GPA this time):

~~~{ .python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
...
julia.gpa = 3.33
print(julia)
~~~

The `gpa` field is now set to 3.33:

~~~{ caption=""}
Student(name='Julia', roll_no=0.5, major='Statistics', year='sophomore',↩
 gpa=3.33, classes=['Statistics 101', 'Graph theory', 'Real analysis'])
~~~

However, it can sometimes be helpful to have immutable instances:

- It prevents accidental modification of one or more instance fields.
- Immutable instances can be hashed by default. Therefore, this is helpful if you'd like to use the instance fields as keys of a dictionary or later dump it into a JSON string.

To make instances immutable, set the `frozen` parameter in the `@dataclass` decorator to `True`.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
from dataclasses import dataclass,field
...
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Student:
    name: str
    roll_no: str
    major: str
    year: str
    gpa: float
    classes: list = field(default_factory=list)
...
julia = Student('Julia',0.5,'Statistics','sophomore','who cares!',↩
['Statistics 101','Graph theory','Real analysis'])
...
julia.gpa = 3.39
print(julia)
~~~

If you now try to update the `gpa` field as shown, you'll run into a `FrozenInstanceError` exception:

~~~{ caption="Output"}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 18, in <module>
    julia.gpa = 3.39
  File "<string>", line 4, in __setattr__
dataclasses.FrozenInstanceError: cannot assign to field 'gpa'
~~~

## Defining Methods in a Python Data Class

Python data classes are classes, too. So you can define methods. Let's add a simple method `some_method()` that prints out a statement:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
from dataclasses import dataclass,field

@dataclass()
class Student:
    name: str
    roll_no: str
    major: str
    year: str
    gpa: float
    classes: list = field(default_factory=list)
    
    def some_method(self):
        return f"I'm an instance method in {self.__class__.__name__} data class; here for some reason. :)"
...
julia = Student('Julia',0.5,'Statistics','sophomore','who cares!',↩ 
['Statistics 101','Graph theory','Real analysis'])
...
print(julia.some_method())
~~~

You can now access `some_method()` by calling it on any instance of the `Student` data class. Here, we've called it on `julia`:

~~~{ caption="Output"}
I'm an instance method in Student data class; here for some reason. :)
~~~

If you try to inspect the member functions of the `Student` class (again):

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
...
pprint(getmembers(Student,isfunction))
~~~

You'll see that `some_method()` has also been included in the list:

~~~{ caption="Output"}

[('__eq__', <function __create_fn__.<locals>.__eq__ at 0x019B6B20>),
 ('__init__', <function __create_fn__.<locals>.__init__ at 0x019B69B8>),
 ('__repr__', <function __create_fn__.<locals>.__repr__ at 0x019B68E0>),

🔖Data classes don't provide an implementation of the `__str__` method (falls back to `__repr__` which is always implemented for a data class). If you'd like, you can add a `__str__` for users of the class instead of `some_method()`.

Though you can add methods to the data class, if you find yourself adding too many methods, you should consider rewriting the data class as a regular Python class instead.

## Conclusion

I hope this tutorial helped you understand the basics of Python data classes. Let's review what we've learned in this tutorial.

We covered how to create data classes (without much boilerplate code) and set default values for one or more fields. In addition, we looked at the usefulness of type hints and immutable data class instances. As a next step, you can try rewriting existing data-oriented Python classes as data classes.

The [next article](/blog/more-on-python-data-classes/) in the series covers inheritance in Python data classes, performance optimizations that were introduced in Python 3.10, and much more. Happy coding!

## Background: Fingers, Head, and Google

Some actions are just in my fingers. I don't have to remember how to use them. My fingers know how. My alias for `git commit` is my fingers. I commit my work almost automatically when I reach a stopping point. Other actions, I know how they work, but I have to think about it every time. They are in my head, not my fingers.[^1]

Some things never stick in my head, nor my fingers. I have to go to google every time. **`jq` is one of these.**

It's time to fix that. **Let's go over `jq` in enough depth that you won't have to head to google next time you need to use it.**

## What Is JQ

`jq` is a lightweight, command-line JSON processor. To use it, you construct one or more filters, and it applies those filters to a JSON document.

The simplest filter is the identity filter which returns all its input (`.`):

``` bash
$ echo '{"key1":{"key2":"value1"}}' | jq '.'
```

``` json
{
  "key1": {
    "key2": "value1"
  }
}
```

This filter is handy for just pretty-printing a JSON document.

<div class="notice--info">
**Side Note: Pretty Printing**

By default, `jq` pretty-prints all its output. This means that its output is not character-for-character identical to its input. I'm going to ignore the pretty-printing. It's not the hard part of the tool.
</div>

## Using JQ to Select Elements

Let's start with the GitHub repository API and use `jq` to select the data we need. The default data returned looks like this:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq
```

``` json
{
  "id": 5101141,
  "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAxMTQx",
  "name": "jq",
  "full_name": "stedolan/jq",
  "private": false,
  "owner": {
    "login": "stedolan",
    "id": 79765
  },
  "html_url": "https://github.com/stedolan/jq",
  "description": "Command-line JSON processor",
  "stargazers_count": 19967,
  "watchers_count": 19967,
  "language": "C",
  "license": {
    "key": "other",
    "name": "Other",
    "spdx_id": "NOASSERTION",
    "url": null,
    "node_id": "MDc6TGljZW5zZTA="
  }
}
```

<div class="notice--info">
**Side Note: Omitting Details**

The JSON documents returned by the GitHub API are too large to show inline in a blog post. Therefore, for ease of explanation, I will omit non-relevant details.
</div>

`jq` lets us treat the JSON document as an object and select elements inside of it.

Here is how I filter the JSON document to select the value of the `name` key:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq | jq ' .name' 
```

```
"jq"
```

<figcaption></figcaption>

Similarly, for selecting the value of the `owner` key:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq | jq ' .owner' 
```

``` json
{
    "login": "stedolan",
    "id": 79765
}
```

You can drill in as far as you want like this:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq | jq ' .owner.login' 
```

```
"stedolan"
```

<div class="notice--big--primary">

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->
**What I Learned: Object Identifier-Index**

`jq` lets you select elements in a JSON document like it's a JavaScript object. Just start with `.` ( for the whole document) and drill down to the value you want.
It ends up looking something like this:

``` bash
jq '.key.subkey.subsubkey'
```

</div>

## Using JQ to Select Arrays

If you use the GitHub Issues API for `jq` you will get back an array of issues:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=5    
```

``` json
[
  {
    "id": 966024429,
    "number": 2341,
    "title": "Question about license.",
    "body": "I would like to create a [winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) package for jq. üôèüèª"
  },
  {
  
    "id": 962477084,
    "number": 2340,
    "title": "visibility of wiki pages",
    "body": "The visibility of wiki pages to search engines is generally limited; for example, the search result for \"jq Cookbook\" looks like this:"
  },
  {
   
    "id": 955350543,
    "number": 2337,
    "title": "Release 1.6 does not have pre-autoreconf'ed configure script",
    "body": "If you have a usage question, please ask us on either Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jq) or in the #jq channel (http://irc.lc/freenode/%23jq/) on Freenode (https://webchat.freenode.net/)."
  },
  {
    "id": 954792209,
    "number": 2336,
    "title": "Fix typo",
    "body": ""
  },
  {
    "id": 940627936,
    "number": 2334,
    "title": "Compile error messages don't provide column only line number",
    "body": "Compile errors in filter expressions don't include the column number where the parser approximately or exactly locates the error. Most filter expressions are one-liners (are multiple lines even supported?), so the information that the error is on line 1 is not helpful."
  }
]
```

To get a specific element in the array, give an index:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=5 | jq '.[4]' 
```

``` json
 {
    "id": 940627936,
    "number": 2334,
    "title": "Compile error messages don't provide column only line number",
    "body": "Compile errors in filter expressions don't include the column number where the parser approximately or exactly locates the error. Most filter expressions are one-liners (are multiple lines even supported?), so the information that the error is on line 1 is not helpful."
  }
```

<div class="notice--info">
**Side Note: Array Indexing in `jq`**

Array indexing has some helpful convenience.

You can select ranges:

``` bash
$ echo "[1,2,3,4,5]" | jq '.[2:4]'
```

``` json
[3,4]
```

You can select one sided ranges:

``` bash
$ echo "[1,2,3,4,5]" | jq '.[2:]'
```

``` json
[3,4,5]
```

You can use negatives to select from the end:

``` bash
$ echo "[1,2,3,4,5]" | jq '.[-2:]'
```

``` json
[4,5]
```

</div>

You can use the array indexing with the object indexing:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=5 | jq '.[4].title' 
```

```
"Compile error messages don't provide column only line number"
```

And you can use `[]` to get all the elements in the array. This is handy when for further filtering the array contents (which I'll be doing shortly).

Here is how I would get the titles of the jq issues returned by my API request:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=5 | jq '.[].title' 
```

```
"Question about license."
"visibility of wiki pages"
"Release 1.6 does not have pre-autoreconf'ed configure script"
"Fix typo"
"Compile error messages don't provide column only line number"
```

<div class="notice--big--primary">
**What I Learned: Array-Index**

`jq` lets you select the whole array `[]`, a specific elements `[3]`, or ranges `[2:5]` and combine these with object index where needed.

It ends up looking something like this:

``` bash
jq '.key[].subkey[2]
```

</div>

<div class="notice--info">
**Side Note: Removing Quotes From JQ Output**

The `-r` option in `jq` gives you raw strings if you need that.

``` bash
$ echo '["1","2","3"]' | jq -r '.[]'
1
2
3
```

The `-j` option (for join) can combine together your output.

```bash
$ echo '["1","2","3"]' | jq -j '.[]'
123
```

</div>

## Putting Elements in an Array using `jq`

Not everything emitted by `jq` is proper JSON. The titles I output were in a new line delimited list:

```
"Question about license."
"visibility of wiki pages"
"Release 1.6 does not have pre-autoreconf'ed configure script"
"Fix typo"
"Compile error messages don't provide column only line number"
...
```

 To put a collection of results produced by a filter into a JSON array, you can wrap it in `[ ... ]` where `...` is a filter.

 My title filter (`.[].title`) then becomes `[ .[].title ]` like this:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=5 | \
  jq '[ .[].title ] ' 
```

``` json
[
  "Question about license.",
  "visibility of wiki pages",
  "Release 1.6 does not have pre-autoreconf'ed configure script",
  "Fix typo",
  "Compile error messages don't provide column only line number"
]
```

Now I have a valid JSON document.

## Using `jq` to Select Multiple Fields

The GitHub issues API has a lot of details I don't care about. I want to select multiple fields from the document returned and leave the rest behind.

The easiest way to do this is using `,` to specify multiple filters:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=2 | \ 
  jq ' .[].title, .[].number'
```

```
"Question about license."
"visibility of wiki pages"
2341
2340
```

But this is returning the result of one selection after the other. To change the ordering, I can factor out the array selector:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=2 | \
  jq '.[] |  .title, .number'
```

```
"Question about license."
2341
"visibility of wiki pages"
2340
```

This uses pipes, which I'll talk about shortly, and run my object selectors per element.

If you wrap the query in the array constructor you get this:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=2 | \
  jq '[ .[] |  .title, .number ]'
```

``` json
[
  "Question about license.",
  2341,
  "visibility of wiki pages",
  2340
]
```

But this still isn't the JSON document I need. To get these values into a proper JSON document, I need the object constructor `{ ... }`. The object construction syntax lets you build a JSON object by using `jq` filters for both keys and values:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=2 | \
  jq '[ .[] | { title: .title, number: .number} ]'
```

``` json
[
  {
    "title": "Question about license.",
    "number": 2341
  },
  {
    "title": "visibility of wiki pages",
    "number": 2340
  }
]

```

<div class="notice--big--primary">
**What I Learned: Array and Object Constructors**

To put the elements you've selected back into a JSON document, you can wrap them in an array constructor `[ .. ]` or an object constructor `{ ... }`.

If you were emitting an array of objects you constructed, then it would end up looking something like this:

``` bash
jq '[ { key1: <<jq filter>>, key2: <<jq filter>> } ]'

```

Both keys and value can be `jq` filters.
</div>

## Sorting and Counting With JQ

The next problem I have is that I want to summarize some this JSON data. Each issue returned by GitHub has a collection of labels:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues/2289    
  jq ' { title: .title, number: .number, labels: .labels} '
```

``` json
  {
    "title": "Bump jinja2 from 2.10 to 2.11.3 in /docs",
    "number": 2289,
    "labels": [
      "feature request",
      "dependencies"
    ]
  }
```

If I want those labels in alphabetical order I can use the built in `sort` function. It works like this:

``` bash
$  echo '["3","2","1"]' | jq 'sort'
["1", "2", "3"]
```

I can combine this built-in jq function with my existing filter, but first, I should explain pipes and filters.

`jq` is a filter: You pipe a JSON document to it, and it filters and outputs it. But the `jq` language is also made up of filters itself.

In fact, most of the things I've used so far are filters:

- `.title` is a filter that only returns the values of key 'title'.  
- `[]` is a filter that, given an array, returns the elements of the array.
- `[2:4]` is a filter that, given an array, returns elements 2 through 4.

 You can join these filters together using `jq`'s built-in functions. You do this using a pipe (`|`) just like in a UNIX shell.

- `.title | length` will return the length of the title
- `[] | sort` will return the array elements in sorted order
- `.number | tostring` will return our issue number as a string

This means that sorting my labels is simple. I can just change `.labels` to `.labels | sort`:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues/2289 | \
  jq ' { title: .title, number: .number, labels: .labels | sort } '    
```

``` json
  {
    "title": "Bump jinja2 from 2.10 to 2.11.3 in /docs",
    "number": 2289,
    "labels": [
      "dependencies",
      "feature request"
    ]
  }
```

And if you want just a label count that is easy as well:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues/2289 | \
  jq ' { title: .title, number: .number, labels: .labels | length } '    
```

``` json
  {
    "title": "Bump jinja2 from 2.10 to 2.11.3 in /docs",
    "number": 2289,
    "labels": 2
  }
```

<div class="notice--big--primary">
**What I Learned: Pipes and built-ins**

`jq` has many built-in functions, and you can combine them with your queries using the pipe operator (`|`).

If you were emitting an array of objects then it ends up looking something like this:

``` bash
jq ' .key1.subkey2[] | sort ' # sorting
jq ' .key2.subkey | length' # length of string or array
jq ' .key3 | floor | tostring | length' # and so on

```

</div>

## Maps and Selects Using JQ

The `jq` issues list has many non-issues: people can't figure out how to do something and open an issue. **Attention Internet: Please don't do this.** GitHub issues aren't the place to post your random homework problem.

Let's say I want to grab all the issues that are labeled. This would let me skip all the drive-by fix-my-problem issues. Unfortunately, it's impossible to do this with the GitHub API unless you specify all the possible labels in your query. Never fear though, we can easily do this query on the command line by filtering our results with `jq`.

Our query so far looks like this:

``` bash
  jq '[ .[] | { title: .title, number: .number, labels: .labels | length } ]'
```

The first thing we can do is simplify it using `map`.  

``` bash
  jq 'map({ title: .title, number: .number, labels: .labels | length }) 
```

You can think of `map(...)` as a shorthand for `[ .[] | ...  ]`. It lets you unwrap an array, apply the filter and then rewrap the results back into an array.

We can combine that with a select statement that looks like this:

``` bash
map(select(.labels > 0))
```

`select` is a built-in function that takes a boolean expression and only returns elements that match. It's similar to the `WHERE` clause in a SQL statement or array filter in JavaScript.

Putting this all together looks like this:

``` bash
curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=100 | \
   jq 'map({ title: .title, number: .number, labels: .labels | length }) | 
   map(select(.labels > 0))'
```

``` json
[
  {
    "title": "Bump lxml from 4.3.1 to 4.6.3 in /docs",
    "number": 2295,
    "labels": 1
  },
  {
    "title": "Bump pyyaml from 3.13 to 5.4 in /docs",
    "number": 2291,
    "labels": 1
  },
  {
    "title": "Bump jinja2 from 2.10 to 2.11.3 in /docs",
    "number": 2289,
    "labels": 1
  },
  {
    "title": "Debugging help through showing pipeline intermediates. ",
    "number": 2206,
    "labels": 1
  }
]
```

This uses three object indexes, two maps, two pipes, a length function, and a `select` predicate. But if you've followed along, this should all make sense. It's all just composing together filters until you get the result you need.

## JQ CheatSheet

<div class="notice--big--primary">

**What I Learned: JQ CheatSheet**

`jq` lets you select elements by starting with a `.` and accessing keys and arrays like it's a JavaScript Object (which is it is). This feature uses the Object and Array index `jq` creates of a JSON document and look like this:

``` bash
jq '.key[0].subkey[2:3].subsubkey'
```

`jq` contains object constructors `{ ... }` and array constructors `[ ... ]`. You use these when you want to wrap back up something you've pulled out of a JSON document using the above indexes:

``` bash
jq '[ { key1: .key1, key2: .key2 }  ]'
```

`jq` contains built-in functions (`length`,`sort`,`select`,`map`) and pipes (`|`), and you can compose these together just like you can combine pipes and filters in a command-line shell:

``` bash
  jq 'map({ order-of-magitude: .items | length | tostring | length }) 
```

</div>

## Conclusion

This has only been the basics of `jq`. The `jq` query language is a full programming language and you can do lots of exciting things with it. You convert from [JSON to CSV](/blog/convert-to-from-json/#convert-json-to-csv-via-the-command-line-using-jq). You can define you own functions and even [find primes](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#jq) with `jq`:

``` haskell
# Denoting the input by $n, which is assumed to be a positive integer,
# eratosthenes/0 produces an array of primes less than or equal to $n:
def eratosthenes:
  (. + 1) as $n
  | (($n|sqrt) / 2) as $s
  | [null, null, range(2; $n)]
  | reduce (2, 1 + (2 * range(1; $s))) as $i (.; erase($i))
  | map(select(.));
```

 However, simple stuff -- like selecting elements, filtering by key, or value -- is often all you need.

I hope this helps make `jq` more approachable and that you no longer have to go to google every time you want to query a JSON document.

# Outline
# Intro
Some shortcuts and command line tools I use so much that using them is just in my fingers. I don't have to remember how to use them, my fingers just know how. 

I hit save in VS Code all the time, despite the fact that VS Code autosaves. It's like a nervous tick that is in my fingers. If I pause my typing my fingers hit Command-S. The shortcut for saving files is in my fingers. 

`git commit / git add` is simarly in my fingers. I have an alias for commiting and I often due it almost automatically when I reach a stopping point. Rebasing changes into my code is different. It's in my head not my fingers. I have to think about each time maybe search my history for it.

However, some things I have to head to google every time I use them. They've never stuck in my brain nor my fingers. JQ is one of these. It's time to fix that. Let's go over selecting elements out of a JSON string using JQ in enough depth that it should stick in both my and your head.

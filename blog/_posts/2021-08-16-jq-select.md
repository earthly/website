## Background: Fingers, Head, and Google

Some actions are just in my fingers. I don't have to remember how to use them. My fingers know how. My alias for `git commit` is my fingers. I commit my work almost automatically when I reach a stopping point. Other actions, I know how they work, but I have to think about it every time. They are in my head, not my fingers.[^1]

Some things never stick in my head, nor my fingers. I have to go to google every time. **`jq` is one of these.**

It's time to fix that. **Let's go over `jq` in enough depth that you won't have to head to google next time you need to use it.**

## What Is JQ

`jq` is a lightweight, command-line JSON processor. I install it with brew (`brew install jq`), but it's a single portable executable, so it's easy to install on linux, windows, and MacOS. 

To use it, you construct one or more filters, and it applies those filters to a JSON document.

The simplest filter is the identity filter which returns all its input (`.`):

``` bash
$ echo '{"key1":{"key2":"value1"}}' | jq '.'
```

``` json
{
  "key1": {
    "key2": "value1"
  }
}
```

This filter is handy for just pretty-printing a JSON document.[^2]

## Using JQ to Select Elements

Let's start with the GitHub repository API and use `jq` to select the data we need. The default data returned looks like this:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq
```

``` json
{
  "id": 5101141,
  "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAxMTQx",
  "name": "jq",
  "full_name": "stedolan/jq",
  "private": false,
  "owner": {
    "login": "stedolan",
    "id": 79765
  },
  "html_url": "https://github.com/stedolan/jq",
  "description": "Command-line JSON processor",
  "stargazers_count": 19967,
  "watchers_count": 19967,
  "language": "C",
  "license": {
    "key": "other",
    "name": "Other",
    "spdx_id": "NOASSERTION",
    "url": null,
    "node_id": "MDc6TGljZW5zZTA="
  }
}
```

<div class="notice--info">
**Side Note: Omitting Details**

The JSON documents returned by the GitHub API are too large to show inline in a blog post. Therefore, for ease of explanation, I will omit non-relevant details.
</div>

`jq` lets us treat the JSON document as an object and select elements inside of it.

Here is how I filter the JSON document to select the value of the `name` key:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq | jq ' .name' 
```

```
"jq"
```

<figcaption></figcaption>

Similarly, for selecting the value of the `owner` key:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq | jq ' .owner' 
```

``` json
{
    "login": "stedolan",
    "id": 79765
}
```

You can drill in as far as you want like this:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq | jq ' .owner.login' 
```

```
"stedolan"
```

<div class="notice--big--primary">

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->
**What I Learned: Object Identifier-Index**

`jq` lets you select elements in a JSON document like it's a JavaScript object. Just start with `.` ( for the whole document) and drill down to the value you want.
It ends up looking something like this:

``` bash
jq '.key.subkey.subsubkey'
```

</div>

## Using JQ to Select Arrays

If you `curl` the GitHub Issues API, you will get back an array of issues:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=5    
```

``` json
[
  {
    "id": 966024429,
    "number": 2341,
    "title": "Question about license.",
    "body": "I would like to create a [winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) package for jq. üôèüèª"
  },
  {
  
    "id": 962477084,
    "number": 2340,
    "title": "visibility of wiki pages",
    "body": "The visibility of wiki pages to search engines is generally limited; for example, the search result for \"jq Cookbook\" looks like this:"
  },
  {
   
    "id": 955350543,
    "number": 2337,
    "title": "Release 1.6 does not have pre-autoreconf'ed configure script",
    "body": "If you have a usage question, please ask us on either Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jq) or in the #jq channel (http://irc.lc/freenode/%23jq/) on Freenode (https://webchat.freenode.net/)."
  },
  {
    "id": 954792209,
    "number": 2336,
    "title": "Fix typo",
    "body": ""
  },
  {
    "id": 940627936,
    "number": 2334,
    "title": "Compile error messages don't provide column only line number",
    "body": "Compile errors in filter expressions don't include the column number where the parser approximately or exactly locates the error. Most filter expressions are one-liners (are multiple lines even supported?), so the information that the error is on line 1 is not helpful."
  }
]
```

To get a specific element in the array, give `jq` an index:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=5 | jq '.[4]' 
```

``` json
 {
    "id": 940627936,
    "number": 2334,
    "title": "Compile error messages don't provide column only line number",
    "body": "Compile errors in filter expressions don't include the column number where the parser approximately or exactly locates the error. Most filter expressions are one-liners (are multiple lines even supported?), so the information that the error is on line 1 is not helpful."
  }
```

<div class="notice--info">
**Side Note: Array Indexing in `jq`**

Array indexing has some helpful convenience.

You can select ranges:

``` bash
$ echo "[1,2,3,4,5]" | jq '.[2:4]'
```

``` json
[3,4]
```

You can select one sided ranges:

``` bash
$ echo "[1,2,3,4,5]" | jq '.[2:]'
```

``` json
[3,4,5]
```

You can use negatives to select from the end:

``` bash
$ echo "[1,2,3,4,5]" | jq '.[-2:]'
```

``` json
[4,5]
```

</div>

You can use the array index with the object index:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=5 | jq '.[4].title' 
```

```
"Compile error messages don't provide column only line number"
```

And you can use `[]` to get all the elements in the array. You can also combine this with the Object Identifier index. For example, here is how I would get the titles of the issues returned by my API request:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=5 | jq '.[].title' 
```

```
"Question about license."
"visibility of wiki pages"
"Release 1.6 does not have pre-autoreconf'ed configure script"
"Fix typo"
"Compile error messages don't provide column only line number"
```

<div class="notice--big--primary">
**What I Learned: Array-Index**

`jq` lets you select the whole array `[]`, a specific elements `[3]`, or ranges `[2:5]` and combine these with object index where needed.

It ends up looking something like this:

``` bash
jq '.key[].subkey[2]
```

</div>

<div class="notice--info">
**Side Note: Removing Quotes From JQ Output**

The `-r` option in `jq` gives you raw strings if you need that.

``` bash
$ echo '["1","2","3"]' | jq -r '.[]'
1
2
3
```

The `-j` option (for join) can combine together your output.

```bash
$ echo '["1","2","3"]' | jq -j '.[]'
123
```

</div>

## Putting Elements in an Array using `jq`

Once you start using the array index to select elements, you have a new problem. The data returned won't be a valid JSON document. In the example above, the issue titles were new line delimited:

```
"Question about license."
"visibility of wiki pages"
"Release 1.6 does not have pre-autoreconf'ed configure script"
"Fix typo"
"Compile error messages don't provide column only line number"
...
```
In fact, whenever you ask `jq` to return an unwrapped collection of elements, it prints them each on a new line. You can see this by explicitly asking `jq` to ignore its input and instead return two numbers:

``` bash
$ echo '""' | jq '1,2' 
1
2
```
You can resolve this the same way you would turn the text `1,2` into an array in JavaScript: By wrapping it in an array constructor `[ ... ]`.

``` bash
$ echo '""' | jq '[1,2]' 
```
``` json
[
  1,
  2
]
```
Similarly, to put a collection of results produced using an array index into a JSON array, you wrap it in `[ ... ]`.

My GitHub issue title filter (`.[].title`) then becomes `[ .[].title ]` like this:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=5 | \
  jq '[ .[].title ] ' 
```

``` json
[
  "Question about license.",
  "visibility of wiki pages",
  "Release 1.6 does not have pre-autoreconf'ed configure script",
  "Fix typo",
  "Compile error messages don't provide column only line number"
]
```

Now I have a valid JSON document.

<div class="notice--big--primary">

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->
**What I Learned: Array Constructor**

If your `jq` query returns more than one element, they will be returned new line delimited. 
``` bash
$ echo '[{"a":"b"},{"a":"c"}]' | jq -r '.[].a'
  "b"
  "c"
```

To turn these values into a JSON array, what you do is similar to creating an array in JavaScript: You wrap the values in an array constructor (`[...]`). 

It ends up looking something like this:
``` bash
$ echo '[{"a":"b"},{"a":"c"}]' | jq -r '[ .[].a ]'
```
``` json
[
  "b",
  "c"
]
```

</div>

## Using `jq` to Select Multiple Fields

The GitHub issues API has a lot of details I don't care about. I want to select multiple fields from the returned JSON document and leave the rest behind.

The easiest way to do this is using `,` to specify multiple filters:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=2 | \ 
  jq ' .[].title, .[].number'
```

```
"Question about license."
"visibility of wiki pages"
2341
2340
```

But this is returning the results of one selection after the other. To change the ordering, I can factor out the array selector:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=2 | \
  jq '.[] |  .title, .number'
```

```
"Question about license."
2341
"visibility of wiki pages"
2340
```

This refactoring uses a pipe (|), which I'll talk about shortly, and runs my object selectors (`.title` and `.number`) on each array element.

If you wrap the query in the array constructor you get this:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=2 | \
  jq '[ .[] |  .title, .number ]'
```

``` json
[
  "Question about license.",
  2341,
  "visibility of wiki pages",
  2340
]
```

But this still isn't the JSON document I need. To get these values into a proper JSON object, I need an object constructor `{ ... }`. 

## Putting Elements Into an Object Using `jq`

Let's look at some simple examples before showing how an object constructor can be used with the GitHub API. 

### A Little Example

I have an array that contains my name (`["Adam","Gordon","Bell"]`), and I want to turn it into a JSON object like this:

``` json
{
  "first-name":"Adam",
  "last-name:"Bell"
}
```
I can select the elements I need using array indexing like this:
``` bash
$ echo '["Adam","Gordon","Bell"]' | jq -r '.[0], .[2]'
Adam
Bell
```

To wrap those values into the shape I need, I can replace the values with the array indexes that return them:
``` json
{
  "first-name":.[0],
  "last-name":.[2]
}
```
Or on a single line like this:
``` bash
$ echo '["Adam","Gordon","Bell"]' | jq -r '{ "first-name":.[0], "last-name": .[2]}'
```
``` json
{
  "first-name": "Adam",
  "last-name": "Bell"
}
```
This syntax is the same syntax for creating an object in a JSON document. The only difference is you can use the object and array queries you've built up as the values.

### Back to GitHub

Returning to my GitHub API problem, to wrap the number and the title up into an array I use the object constructor like this:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=2 | \
  jq '[ .[] | { title: .title, number: .number} ]'
```

``` json
[
  {
    "title": "Question about license.",
    "number": 2341
  },
  {
    "title": "visibility of wiki pages",
    "number": 2340
  }
]

```

<div class="notice--big--primary">
**What I Learned: Object Constructors**

To put the elements you've selected back into a JSON document, you can wrap them in an object constructor `{ ... }`.

If you were building up a JSON object out of several selectors, it would end up looking something like this:

``` bash
jq '{ "key1": <<jq filter>>, "key2": <<jq filter>> }'
```

Which is the same syntax for an object in a JSON document, except with `jq` you can use filters as values.[^3]
</div>

## Sorting and Counting With JQ

The next problem I have is that I want to summarize some this JSON data. Each issue returned by GitHub has a collection of labels:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues/2289    
  jq ' { title: .title, number: .number, labels: .labels} '
```

``` json
  {
    "title": "Bump jinja2 from 2.10 to 2.11.3 in /docs",
    "number": 2289,
    "labels": [
      "feature request",
      "dependencies"
    ]
  }
```
### `jq` Built-in Functions

If I want those labels in alphabetical order I can use the built in `sort` function. It works like this:

``` bash
$  echo '["3","2","1"]' | jq 'sort'
["1", "2", "3"]
```
This is similar to how I would sort an array in JavaScript:

``` JavaScript
const l = ["3","2","1"];
l.sort();
```
Other built-ins that mirror JavaScript functionality are available, like `length`, `reverse`, and `tostring` and they can all be used in a similar way:
``` bash
$  echo '["3","2","1"]' | jq 'reverse'
["1", "2", "3"]
$  echo '["3","2","1"]' | jq 'length'
3
```
If I can combine these built-ins with the selectors I've built up so far I'll have solved my label sorting problem. I'll show that next.

<div class="notice--big--primary">
**What I Learned: `jq` built-ins**

`jq` has many built-in functions. Probably too many to remember, so you might need to head to google or the [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Builtinoperatorsandfunctions). But before you do, the built-ins tend to mirror what exists in JavaScript, so give the functions you know a try and you might get lucky.[^4]
</div>

### Pipes and Filters

Before I can combine `sort` with my existing filter to sort the labels from my GitHub API request, I need to explain how pipes and filters work in `jq`.

`jq` is a filter in the UNIX command line sense. You pipe (`|`) a JSON document to it, and it filters it and outputs it to standard out. However, the `jq` language itself can also contain filters.

In fact, most of the things I've used so far are filters:

- `.title` is a filter that only returns the values of key 'title'.  
- `[]` is a filter that, given an array, returns the elements of the array.
- `[2:4]` is a filter that, given an array, returns elements 2 through 4.

 You can join these filters together with themselves or with `jq`'s built-in functions. You do this using a pipe (`|`), just like in a UNIX shell.

- `.title | length` will return the length of the title
- `[] | sort` will return the array elements in sorted order
- `.number | tostring` will return our issue number as a string
- ` .[] | .key ` will return the values of key `key` in the array (equivalent to this `.[].key`)

This means that sorting my GitHub issue labels is simple. I can just change `.labels` to `.labels | sort`:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues/2289 | \
  jq ' { title: .title, number: .number, labels: .labels | sort } '    
```

``` json
  {
    "title": "Bump jinja2 from 2.10 to 2.11.3 in /docs",
    "number": 2289,
    "labels": [
      "dependencies",
      "feature request"
    ]
  }
```

And if you want just a label count that is easy as well:

``` bash
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues/2289 | \
  jq ' { title: .title, number: .number, labels: .labels | length } '    
```

``` json
  {
    "title": "Bump jinja2 from 2.10 to 2.11.3 in /docs",
    "number": 2289,
    "labels": 2
  }
```

<div class="notice--big--primary">
**What I Learned: Pipes and Filters**

Everything in `jq` is a filter and can be combined with pipes (`|`). This mimics the behaviour of a UNIX shell. You can use the pipes along with the `jq` built-ins to built up complicated transformations from simple operations. 

It ends up looking something like this:
``` bash
jq ' .key1.subkey2[] | sort ' # sorting
jq ' .key2.subkey | length' # length of string or array
jq ' .key3 | floor | tostring | length' # and so on

```
</div>

## Maps and Selects Using JQ

The issues list I was looking at has many low quality issues in it.[^9] Let's say I want to grab all the issues that are labeled. This would let me skip all the drive-by fix-my-problem issues. Unfortunately, it's impossible to do this with the GitHub API unless you specify all the possible labels in your query. However, I can easily do this query on the command line by filtering our results with `jq`. To do so, I'm going to need a couple more `jq` functions though.

Our query so far looks like this:

``` bash
  jq '[ .[] | { title: .title, number: .number, labels: .labels | length } ]'
```

The first thing we can do is simplify it using `map`.  

``` bash
  jq 'map({ title: .title, number: .number, labels: .labels | length }) 
```

`map(...)` lets you unwrap an array, apply a filter and then rewrap the results back into an array. You can think of as a shorthand for `[ .[] | ...  ]` and it comes up quite a bit in my experience so it's worth commiting to memory.

We can combine that with a select statement that looks like this:

``` bash
map(select(.labels > 0))
```

`select` is a built-in function that takes a boolean expression and only returns elements that match. It's similar to the `WHERE` clause in a SQL statement or array filter in JavaScript. 

Like `map`, I find `select` comes up quite a bit, so while you may have to come back to this article or google it the first few times you need it, with luck it will start to stick to your memory after that.

Putting this all together looks like this:

``` bash
curl https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/issues?per_page=100 | \
   jq 'map({ title: .title, number: .number, labels: .labels | length }) | 
   map(select(.labels > 0))'
```

``` json
[
  {
    "title": "Bump lxml from 4.3.1 to 4.6.3 in /docs",
    "number": 2295,
    "labels": 1
  },
  {
    "title": "Bump pyyaml from 3.13 to 5.4 in /docs",
    "number": 2291,
    "labels": 1
  },
  {
    "title": "Bump jinja2 from 2.10 to 2.11.3 in /docs",
    "number": 2289,
    "labels": 1
  },
  {
    "title": "Debugging help through showing pipeline intermediates. ",
    "number": 2206,
    "labels": 1
  }
]
```

This uses three object indexes, two maps, two pipes, a `length` function, and a `select` predicate. But if you've followed along, this should all make sense. It's all just composing together filters until you get the result you need. 

Now lets talk about how we can put this knowledge into practice. 

## In Review

<div class="notice--big--primary">

**What I Learned **

Here is what I've learned so far:

`jq` lets you select elements by starting with a `.` and accessing keys and arrays like it's a JavaScript Object (which is it is). This feature uses the Object and Array index `jq` creates of a JSON document and look like this:

``` bash
jq '.key[0].subkey[2:3].subsubkey'
```

`jq` contains object constructors `{ ... }` and array constructors `[ ... ]`. You use these when you want to wrap back up something you've pulled out of a JSON document using the above indexes:

``` bash
jq '[ { key1: .key1, key2: .key2 }  ]'
```

`jq` contains built-in functions (`length`,`sort`,`select`,`map`) and pipes (`|`), and you can compose these together just like you can combine pipes and filters in a command-line shell:

``` bash
  jq 'map({ order-of-magitude: .items | length | tostring | length }) 
```

</div>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD036 -->

### Next Steps For Mastering `jq`

Reading about (or writing about) a tool is not enough to master it. Action is needed. Here is my process for cementing this knowledge:

#### 1. Complete the `jq` Tutorial

[jq-tutorial](https://github.com/rjz/jq-tutorial) is not a tutorial at all, but a collection of around 20 interactive exercises that test you knowledge of `jq`. I've found it very helpful for cementing my knowledge of `jq`.

#### 2. Try Using Your Memory First
Whenever I need to extract data or transform a JSON document I try to do it at first without looking anything up. Often I still end up needing to look something up but science has show that [repeated retrieval yields retention](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3983480/). So overtime my retention should improve.

#### 3. Use It

If you don't use a tool, you will never master it. So when I have a task that can solved using `jq`, for the next little while at least, I'll be trying using `jq` to solve it. Even if there is an easier way to do it. Even if its just exploring a JSON document using [jqplay.org](https://jqplay.org/) or looking at `docker inspect` results. Why use postman to explore an API when `curl` and `jq` are at hand?

I think if you follow me in these steps using `jq` will become second nature. 

## Conclusion

So far I've only covered the basics of `jq`. The `jq` query language is a full programming language and you can do lots of exciting things with it. You convert from [JSON to CSV](/blog/convert-to-from-json/#convert-json-to-csv-via-the-command-line-using-jq). You can define you own functions and even [find primes](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#jq) with `jq`:

``` haskell
# Denoting the input by $n, which is assumed to be a positive integer,
# eratosthenes/0 produces an array of primes less than or equal to $n:
def eratosthenes:
  (. + 1) as $n
  | (($n|sqrt) / 2) as $s
  | [null, null, range(2; $n)]
  | reduce (2, 1 + (2 * range(1; $s))) as $i (.; erase($i))
  | map(select(.));
```

 However, simple stuff -- like selecting elements, filtering by key, or value -- is often all you need.

I hope this helps make `jq` more approachable and that you no longer have to go to google every time you want to query a JSON document.

Vlad was on [devtools.FM](https://www.devtools.fm/episode/71)!

He talked about the hardest part of startups:

> The go-to-market part of a company is always the hardest. Maybe unless you're building rockets, self-driving cars or something, it's almost always the go-to-market that is harder than the tech.

He also discussed pricing:

> So we've taken a very different stance with regards to pricing. We said, okay, compute should be billed at cost. We make zero profit from compute, and instead you will give us more money for the seat. And this will represent a more realistic value of what you actually pay for

And a bunch more. Check it out on [devtools.fm](https://www.devtools.fm/episode/71)

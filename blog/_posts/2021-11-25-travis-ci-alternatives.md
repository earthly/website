Travis CI is one of the best known continuous integration (CI) tools on the market. It was founded in 2011 to automate builds and tests for Ruby, but now supports over thirty languages including JavaScript, Python, and Java.

It was an early leader in CI, in which developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository for automated builds and tests, a key aspect of DevOps practices. Today, however, there are plenty of other options.

This article will go through some of the best alternatives to Travis CI and why you might want to choose them.

## Why Choose an Alternative?

Since Travis CI was acquired by a private equity group in 2019, [many things have changed](https://earthly.dev/blog/migrating-from-travis/#what-happened), like its support for open-source projects. For example, it no longer offers a free plan, whereas other competitors like CircleCI do.

The quality of service can differ as well. For instance, Azure DevOps Server has better offers for enterprises, Jenkins offers plenty of open-source benefits, and other tools offer faster builds.

## Why These Alternatives?

There are several factors to consider when choosing a CI tool:

- **Flexibility:** support for popular environments and programming languages
- **Price:** how much it costs to use the tool
- **Reliability:** how reliably the software or the cloud service works
- **Ease of use:** including how to configure the build process and the UI/UX of the tool
- **Resilience:** including everything from build VMs to parallel builds and container support
- **Compatibility:** support for other CI tools like GitHub, Bitbucket, Slack, and Maven

This article will discuss the ten best alternatives to Travis CI, with options for projects of all sizes as well as for open- and closed-source projects, cloud-based projects, and those using self-hosted software.

### [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)

CircleCI is a cloud-based CI tool that's known for good pricing plans and advanced features with fast builds.

- **Flexibility:** CircleCI supports all major programming languages and environments and allows builds on all operating systems.
- **Price:** Its [prices](https://circleci.com/pricing/) start at $30 per month, higher than Travis CI, but it offers a generous free plan.

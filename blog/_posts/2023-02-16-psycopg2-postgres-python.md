Are you a Python programmer learning to work with PostgreSQL? If so, this tutorial on **psycopg2**, the PostgreSQL connector for Python, is for you. You can connect to PostgreSQL databases and run queries‚Äîall from within your Python script‚Äîusing the psycopg2 adapter.

In this tutorial, you'll learn the basics of using `psycopg2` in Python to do the following:

- Connect to a PostgreSQL database
- Run SQL queries against a database: create tables, insert, retrieve, and delete records
- Use context managers in Python to run queries

Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you need to have the following installed in your development environment:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and [Python 3.6 or a later version](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Psycopg2, the Postgres connector for Python. It's available as a PyPI package that you can install using pip:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
pip3 install psycopg2
~~~

<div class="notice--info">
üìù In this tutorial, we'll run SQL queries to perform simple CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database. So familiarity with SQL will be helpful but not required.
</div>

## How to Connect to a PostgreSQL Database

![How to Connect]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/PJsScPe.png)\

<div class="notice--info">
**Before You Begin**

- Ensure that your PostgreSQL database server is up and running, and
- You have a database that you can connect to.

You can create a database on [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) or use the command-line client [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html). If you use psql at the command line, check if you have the right permissions, and run `CREATE DATABASE <sample-db>;`. You can optionally specify the username, host, and port; else, `<sample-db>` is created with the default values for these fields.
</div>

### The `connect()` Function in Psycopg2

> [Download the code and follow along](https://github.com/balapriyac/psycopg2-tutorial).

After you've installed the psycopg2 library, you can import it into your working environment. As a first step, let's create a `main.py` file, import `psycopg2`, and connect to a PostgreSQL database.

To connect to a database, you can use the `connect()` function from psycopg2. The `connect()` function takes in the information needed to connect to the database, such as the name of the database, username, and password, as keyword arguments. It returns a connection object if the connection succeeds. You can use the `connect()` function as shown:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# psycopg2-tutorial/main.py

import psycopg2

db_connection = psycopg2.connect(dbname='test',
                                 user=<username>,
                                 password=<password>,
                                 host='localhost',
                                 port=5432)

print("Successfully connected to the database.")
~~~

In the above code snippet:

- `dbname` is the name of the database that you'd like to connect to. Here, I've connected to the `test` database.
- `user` and `password` are the username and the password required for authentication.
- `host` is the IP address of the server on which your database is running ('localhost' in this case).
- `port` refers to the port number that the server listens to for incoming connection requests to the database. The default value is 5432.

<div class="notice--big--primary">
üìë Specifying the details of the database in the function call, as shown above, is a good example of **how not to connect to a database**.

In practice, you should store the details of the database and the credentials required to connect to it in a config file. You can then parse the config file, retrieve the required details, and use them in the call to the `connect()` function.

**But why is this helpful?** When working on a project, you may need to connect to multiple databases or connect to a database from more than one module. In such cases, if the database credentials change, you can only modify the contents of the config file *without* introducing breaking changes elsewhere.

Also, exposing sensitive info like passwords in source code is a security risk. So you should always store the credentials in a config file or set them as [environment variables](/blog/bash-variables) whose values you can fetch as needed.
</div>

### How to Parse Config Files in Python

The `configparser` module, built into the Python standard library, lets you parse configuration files of the [INI file format](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure).

<div class="notice--info">
If [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) is your preferred config file format, you can use the built-in [`tomllib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tomllib.html#module-tomllib) for parsing. To use `tomllib` you need to have Python 3.11 installed.
</div>

A typical config file consists of multiple sections, with each section having a set of key-value pairs. The keys and values are separated by a `:` or `=`. Here's the general structure of a config file with one section and `n` key-value pairs:

~~~{ caption="config file"}
[section-name]
key1=value1
key2=value2
.
.
.
keyn=valuen
~~~

Let's create the config file `db_info.ini` that stores the details required to connect to the PostgreSQL database. The names of the keyword arguments, `dbname`, `user`, `password`, `host`, and `port`, should be the keys. And the values used for these arguments in the `connect()` function call should be the values in the config file:

~~~{ caption="db_info.ini"}
# psycopg2-tutorial/db_info.ini

[postgres-sample-db]
dbname=test
user=<username>
password=<password>
host=localhost
port=5432
~~~

#### Parsing the Config File with `ConfigParser`

<div class="notice--info">
We'll define helper functions in separate modules and import them inside the `main.py` file as needed. This will ensure that `main.py` contains only the code relevant to psycopg2.
</div>

Let's create `db_config.py` containing the definition of `get_db_info()`, a function that parses the config file and returns the info we need to connect to the database.

~~~{.python caption="db_config.py"}
# psycopg2-tutorial/db_config.py

from configparser import ConfigParser

def get_db_info(filename,section):
    # instantiating the parser object
    parser=ConfigParser()
    parser.read(filename)

    db_info={}
    if parser.has_section(section):
         # items() method returns (key,value) tuples
         key_val_tuple = parser.items(section) 
         for item in key_val_tuple:
             db_info[item[0]]=item[1] # index 0: key & index 1: value

    return db_info
~~~

The function `get_db_info()` takes in the names of the *config file* and the *section* as arguments. It returns the details of the database as a Python dictionary. Under the hood, it works by instantiating a `ConfigParser` object that reads in the config file, taps into the section, and retrieves the key-value pairs.

Now we do the following inside `main.py`:

- Import the `get_db_info()` function from `db_config`,
- Call the `get_db_info()` function with the correct arguments and store the returned dictionary in `db_info`, and
- Use `db_info` in the call to the `connect()` function.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# psycopg2-tutorial/main.py

import psycopg2
from db_config import get_db_info

filename='db_info.ini'
section='postgres-sample-db'
db_info = get_db_info(filename,section)

db_connection = psycopg2.connect(**db_info)
print("Successfully connected to the database.")
~~~

### Handling Connection Errors

Let's recall what we've done so far. We stored the details of the database in a config file, parsed it using `ConfigParser`, and connected to the database using the `connect()` function from `psycopg2`. However, we haven't accounted for the errors that may arise during the connection process.

![Handling Connection Errors]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/74S9Egq.png)\

Suppose you enter an incorrect password (yeah, that happens often!). Open the config file `db_info.ini`, update the password to something *invalid*, and run the script again.

There'll be a runtime error. Focusing on the relevant information in the traceback, you'll see that an `OperationalError` exception is thrown as password authentication failed. Psycopg2 has an implementation of the `OperationalError` class.

~~~{ caption="Output"}
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
psycopg2.OperationalError: connection to server at "localhost" (::1), \
port 5432 failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "postgres"
~~~

What happens when you try connecting to a database that does not exist? For example, I updated the `dbname` field in the config file from `test` to `test1` (the `test1` database does not exist). It's an `OperationalError` exception (again).

~~~{ caption="Output"}
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
psycopg2.OperationalError: connection to server at "localhost" (::1), \
port 5432 failed: FATAL:  database "test1" does not exist
~~~

You can run the script a few more times by changing one or more fields to invalid values. And you'll see that an `OperationalError` exception is thrown in all of the runs.

Therefore, such connection errors that arise due to incorrect or invalid values can all be subsumed under the `OperationalError` exception.

#### Exception Handling Using `try` and `except`

Now, let's import the `OperationalError` class from psycopg2 and handle the `OperationalError` exception using Python's `try` and `except` blocks.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# psycopg2-tutorial/main.py

import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import OperationalError
from db_config import get_db_info


filename='db_info.ini'
section='postgres-sample-db'
db_info = get_db_info(filename,section)

try:
    db_connection = psycopg2.connect(**db_info)
    print("Successfully connected to the database.")

except OperationalError:
    print("Error connecting to the database :/")
~~~

Let's parse what the above code snippet does.

- If the `try` block succeeds, the `connect()` function returns a database connection instance, `db_connection`.
- If an `OperationalError` exception is raised during the connection process, the `except` block is triggered, and we get notified that there was an error connecting to the database.

In essence: we try to connect to the database and run queries when there are no `OperationalError` exceptions.

### A Note on Closing the Connection ü§®

We haven't queried the database yet, so **why** close the connection? We'll discuss this to get a high-level overview of what we're trying to accomplish. Also, it's easier to think coherently about the `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks here.

We know how to connect to a database and handle connection errors. After connecting to the database and querying it, we should *finally* close the connection by calling the `close()` method on the connection object.

You can do this inside a `finally` block. The statements inside the `finally` block are *always* executed, regardless of whether or not the `try` block succeeds. So you may come up with the following:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
from psycopg2 import OperationalError

try:
    # connecting to the db
    # querying the db

except OperationalError:
    # print out the error message

finally:
    # close the db connection
~~~

**This is almost correct, but there's a small problem**. To close a connection, it should *exist*. If the connection fails, then the connection object is never returned. So you'll run into a `NameError` exception trying to close a connection that does not even exist.

To account for this, let's set `db_connection` to `None` initially and close the connection only if it exists: `if db_connection:` is equivalent to `if db_connection is not None:`.

Putting it all together, here's our `main.py` file:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# psycopg2-tutorial/main.py

import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import OperationalError
from db_config import get_db_info


filename='db_info.ini'
section='postgres-sample-db'
db_info = get_db_info(filename,section)

db_connection = None
try:
    db_connection = psycopg2.connect(**db_info)
    print("Successfully connected to the database.")

except OperationalError:
    print("Error connecting to the database :/")

finally:
    if db_connection:
        db_connection.close()
        print("Closed connection.")
~~~

## How To Query the Database

So far, we've learned to connect to the database and handle connection errors. Can we start querying the database yet?

### The Cursor Object

There's one more step before you can start running queries: **creating a database cursor**.

Cursors are analogous to file handlers. They let you query databases and fetch results just the way file handlers let you perform I/O operations on files. Once you have a cursor object, you can call methods on it to query the database and fetch the results of the query.

![Database Cursor]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/qC5OaFS.png)

To create a cursor object, you can call the `cursor()` method on the connection object.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
db_cursor = db_connection.cursor()
~~~

<div class="notice--big--primary">
‚ö†Ô∏è For clarity, I'll present the SQL queries and the results as short snippets. But remember, everything we're trying to run is [inside the `try` block](https://github.com/balapriyac/psycopg2-tutorial/blob/main/main.py).
</div>

In the `test` database, let's create a table, `people`. Each record in the table has the fields: **name**, **city**, and **profession**. The SQL query is defined in the string, `create_table`.

To execute the query, call the `execute()` method on the cursor object, `db_cursor`, and pass in the query string, `create_table`.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
create_table = '''CREATE TABLE people(
                          id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                          name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
                          city varchar(40),
                          profession varchar(60));'''
db_cursor.execute(create_table)
~~~

After creating the table, let's insert a record: *Jane Lee* who works as a *Rust programmer* in the fictional city of *Rustmore*.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
insert_record = "INSERT INTO people (name,city,profession) \
VALUES (%s, %s, %s);"
insert_value = ('Jane Lee','Rustmore','Rust programmer')
db_cursor.execute(insert_record, insert_value)
~~~

<div class="notice--info">
Specifying placeholders in the query string and passing in the values as a tuple helps mitigate [SQL injection attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection).
</div>

### Committing Transactions

Now run `main.py`. The script will run without errors. However, if you look up the database, you'll not be able to find the `people` table with Jane Lee's record. Why? Well, for the changes to **persist** in the database, you'll have to **commit** the transaction.

To do so you can either call the `commit()` method on the connection object or set the `autocommit` attribute of the connection object to `True`.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
db_connection.autocommit = True
~~~

Re-run `main.py`.The changes we've made will now persist in the `test` database.

## Inserting Records Into a Table

In the `test` database, we now have a table named `people` containing *only one* record - not very interesting. We need to insert more records into the table. I can spend the rest of the day coming up with names and fictional cities. Or I can generate synthetic data using [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/). You can install Faker using pip: `pip install Faker`.

The `fake_data.py` file contains the `generate_fake_data()` function that'll return a list of (name, city, job) tuples. After instantiating a Faker object, I've set the seed for reproducibility. Without the seed, you'll get a different set of records every time you run the script.

~~~{.python caption="fake_data.py"}
# psycopg2-tutorial/fake_data.py

from faker import Faker

fake = Faker()
Faker.seed(42)

def generate_fake_data(num):
    records = []

    for i in range(num):
        name, city, job = fake.name(), fake.city(), fake.job()
        records.append((name,city,job))
    return records
~~~

Inside the `main.py` file, import `generate_fake_data` from the `fake_data` module. Let's use the `generate_fake_data()` function to generate 100 more records that we can insert into the `people` table.

Here, `records` is a tuple of records. We can loop through it and insert the records into the table by calling the `execute()` method on `db_cursor`.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
from fake_data import generate_fake_data
records = tuple(generate_fake_data(100)) #cast into a tuple for immutability
insert_record = "INSERT INTO people (name,city,profession)\
VALUES (%s, %s, %s);"

for record in records:
    db_cursor.execute(insert_record,record)
~~~

<div class="notice--info">
Instead of looping through the `records` tuple and using the `execute()` method for inserting each record, you can call `executemany()` on the cursor object. Using `db_cursor.executemany(insert_record, records)` yields the same results and is [*not* faster than looping](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/cursor.html#cursor.execute).
</div>

## How to Retrieve Data from Tables

Next, let's read data from the `people` table. We'll run a simple select query to read all the records from the table.

Executing the select query, `SELECT * FROM people;` returns all the records in the table. To *fetch* the results of the query, you can call a few fetch methods on the cursor object. These methods return records from the result as tuples:

### Fetch the Next Record with `fetchone()`

Calling the `fetchone()` method on `db_cursor` fetches the *next* record in the result.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
db_cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM people;")
print(db_cursor.fetchone())
~~~

As this is the first time we're fetching the record, it fetches the *first* record.

~~~{ caption="Output"}
(1, 'Jane Lee', 'Rustmore', 'Rust programmer')
~~~

### Fetch the Next `n` Records with `fetchmany()`

The `fetchmany()` method takes in the number of records to fetch (`n`) and fetches the next `n` records from the result.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
for record in db_cursor.fetchmany(10):
    print(record)
~~~

As we've mentioned 10 in the `fetchmany()` method call, we get the next 10 records: records in rows 2 to 11 in the people table.

(10, 'Daniel Adams', 'New Cynthiaside', 'Financial risk analyst')
(11, 'James Mayo', 'Lake Mark', 'Banker')
~~~

### Fetch All the Remaining Rows with `fetchall()`

Calling the `fetchall()` method on the cursor object returns all the remaining records in the result.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
for record in db_cursor.fetchall():
    print(record)
~~~

We've already fetched the first 11 records in the result. So `fetchall()` fetches all the remaining records.

## Updating and Deleting Records

![Updating and Deleting Records]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/ELPMr4B.png)\

From the cities in the table, I'd like to get the list of all cities that occur more than once.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
get_count ='''SELECT city, COUNT(*)
              FROM people
              GROUP BY city HAVING COUNT(*)>1;'''
db_cursor.execute(get_count)
print(db_cursor.fetchall())
~~~

We see that 'Johnsonmouth' is the only city that appears more than once.

~~~{ caption="Output"}
# Output
[('Johnsonmouth', 2)]

~~~

Let's update both the occurrences of 'Johnsonmouth' to another fictional city, say, 'Mathville'.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
update_query = "UPDATE people SET city=%s WHERE city=%s"
values = ('Mathville','Johnsonmouth')
db_cursor.execute(update_query,values)
~~~

Now let's delete the records where the `city` is 'Mathville'.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
delete_record = "DELETE FROM people WHERE city=%s;"
record = ('Mathville',) # pass in as a tuple
db_cursor.execute(delete_record,record)
~~~

With that, we've run a basic set of queries to insert, retrieve, update, and delete records. So what do we do next? We've already accounted for closing the database connection (finally) after running the queries.

It's a good practice to also close the database cursor. To do this, you can call the `close()` method on the cursor object. But this has to be inside the `finally` block too, before closing the database connection. This is because if the connection object does not exist, the cursor doesn't exist either!

If needed, look up the [main.py](https://github.com/balapriyac/psycopg2-tutorial/blob/main/main.py) file to make sure you've understood it all.

## Simplifying Querying Using Context Managers

So far we've implemented exception handling for errors that arise when trying to connect to a database. We then ran SQL queries to create a table and insert records, retrieve data from the table, and update and delete records. In all of the above, the queries ran *without* errors and returned the desired results. ‚úÖ

In practice, however, some queries may not run as expected! We may run into errors: from syntax errors in the query string to errors arising from attempting invalid transactions.

For example: retrieving, updating, and deleting records make sense only when there *is* a table with records. Psycopg2 provides several [exception classes](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/errors.html#sqlstate-exception-classes) such as `DatabaseError` and `ProgrammingError` that are triggered when the SQL queries fail to run successfully.

In summary: you're not only trying to connect to the database and run a set of queries. Rather, for *each* of the queries, you *try* to run the query (inside a `try` block) and catch any exception (inside the `except` block).

Suppose you need to run `n` queries. If you implement error handling for each of the `n` queries, your script will look like this:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# all imports
from psycopg2 import OperationalError

try:
    # connecting to the db
      try:
          # running query #1
            
      except <ErrorType1>:
            # roll back changes

      try:
          # running query #2
            
      except <ErrorType2>:
            # roll back changes
     
      ...

except OperationalError:
    # print out the error message

finally:
    # close the db connection
~~~

Implementing such error handling for each of the `n` queries can be difficult. And here's where context managers can help.

### Connection and Cursor Objects as Context Managers

In Python, **context managers** can be used to control the execution of a block of statements and the `with` statement can be used to create an execution context.

In general, context managers mitigate resource leakage and help in efficient resource handling. They do this by setting up and tearing down resources when the execution enters and exits the context, respectively.

The connection and cursor objects we've used so far are both context managers. You can use them in `with` statements using the following general syntax:

~~~{.python caption="main2.py"}
# psycopg2-tutorial/main2.py
try:
    with psycopg2.connect(**db_info) as db_connection:
        print("Successfully connected to the database.")

        with db_connection.cursor() as db_cursor:
        # run queries

except OperationalError:
    # print out the error message

finally:
    # close the db connection
~~~

In the above snippet:

- The outer `with` statement wraps a block that executes with the database connection instance as the context manager.
- The inner `with` statement wraps a set of queries that run with the database cursor as the context manager.

**But how does this help?**

When you use the connection object as a context manager:

- All *successful* transactions are *automatically committed* when the execution exits the outer `with` block. Note that the outer `with` block also wraps the creation of the cursor context manager to run the queries. So the set of queries represents a single transaction. If you need to run several hundred queries, you can create multiple connection context managers, each wrapping a database transaction.
- If there are exceptions due to one or more failing queries, changes are rolled back. Without the context manager, you'll have to call the `rollback()` method on the connection object to do this.
- When the cursor object exits a `with` block, it is automatically closed. So you don't have to close the cursor.

<div class="notice--info">
The `finally` block is still there because the connection is *not* automatically closed when the execution exits the block. So you still have to close the connection.
</div>

The version of the code using context managers can be found in the [main2.py](https://github.com/balapriyac/psycopg2-tutorial/blob/main/main2.py) file.

## Working with Psycopg2: A Quick Review

![Working with Psycopg2: A Quick Review]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/ZSRtSV2.png)\

Let's review all that we've learned in this tutorial:

- To connect to databases, psycopg2 provides the `connect()` convenience function. The `connect()` function takes in the details of the database‚Äîas keyword arguments‚Äîand returns a **connection object** if there are no errors.
- You can create a database cursor by calling the `cursor()` method on the connection object.
- To run database queries, call the `execute()` method on the cursor object. Specify the SQL query as a string, use placeholders for values, and pass in the values as tuples. To run multiple queries, you can use `executemany()`, but there are no known performance improvements.
- Fetch the results of the query by calling one of the fetch methods: `fetchone()`, `fetchmany()`, or `fetchall()` on the connection object.
- You can call the `commit()` and `rollback()` methods on the connection object to commit transactions to the database and roll back changes if there's an error, respectively.
- When you run queries using the database connection as a context manager, successful transactions are automatically committed to the database. And changes are rolled back in the event of errors.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, I used a simple example to walk you through the basics of querying PostgreSQL databases using psycopg2. I hope you learned how to connect to databases, run queries, and also handle exceptions during the process.

As a next step, you can add more tables to the database, define relationships among them, and query data from multiple tables. Also, try exploring other [features of psycopg2](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/index.html).

**This article explains Python's `subprocess` module. Earthly streamlines build automation for Python developers. [Learn more about Earthly](https://cloud.earthly.dev/login).**

Python ships with built-in modules such as [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) and [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) that provide some functionality to interact with the underlying operating system. However, it may sometimes be more convenient to run system programs from within a Python script. Python's subprocess module provides ready-to-use functionality to run external commands, capture and process outputs, redirect output to files and I/O streams, and much more!

This guide will help you get started with the subprocess module in Python. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have learned how to:

- Run Bash commands inside Python scripts
- Analyze what happens when an external command fails
- Pipe the output of one subprocess to the input of another subprocess
- Change the environment in which a subprocess runs

Let's begin!

## Python Subprocess Module: The Basics

<div class="notice--big--primary">
**Prerequisites**:
To follow along with this tutorial, you should have [Python 3.7 or a later version](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you're on a [Windows](/blog/makefiles-on-windows) machine, we recommend using [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or installing the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10) to code along. If you prefer using other code editors or IDEs on Windows, you should run the Windows equivalents of some of the Bash commands used in this tutorial.
</div>

The `subprocess` module is built into the Python standard library, so you can import it into your working environment:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
import subprocess
~~~

[Download the code and follow along](https://github.com/balapriyac/Python-Subprocesses/tree/main)\

### How Does Subprocess Execution Occur in Python?

After importing the `subprocess` module, you can call the `run()` function with the syntax: `subprocess.run(command)` to run an external command. This call to the `run()` function invokes a subprocess.

When a subprocess is invoked, the following actions occur under the hood:

- The *Python script* inside which you're running the external command is the **parent process** and the *subprocess* is the **child process**.
- Upon starting a subprocess, the control is transferred from the parent process to the child process.
- The child process executes the external command inside a secondary environment.
- After the child process finishes executing, the control returns to the parent process.

### How to Run a Subprocess With `subprocess.run()`

Calling the `subprocess.run()` function with an external command or program as the argument prints out the output of the command onto the console. The function call also returns a `CompletedProcess` object which has a set of useful attributes.

As our first subprocess, let's run the `ls` command that lists the contents of the working directory:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
process_1 = subprocess.run("ls")
print(process_1)
print(process_1.args)
print(process_1.returncode)
print(process_1.stdout)
~~~

~~~{ caption="Output"}

py_logging main.py  py_unit_testing  string_manipulation
CompletedProcess(args='ls', returncode=0)
ls
0
None
~~~

In the above output:

- The contents of the working directory are printed onto the console.
- The `args` attribute contains the arguments passed to the `run()` function.
- The `returncode` attribute indicates whether the command ran successfully; A return code of zero indicates successful execution.
- If the output of the command is captured, the `stdout` attribute contains the output; if we do not capture the output, `stdout` is `None`.

<div class="notice--big--primary">

### Subprocess Popen Constructor

In the subprocess module, the [Popen class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen) handles the creation and management of subprocesses. However, the `run()` function is recommended for invoking subprocesses and suffices for most common use cases.
</div>

### Running Bash Commands With Arguments

To run Bash commands with arguments, you can specify the name of the command followed by the arguments that it takes. The name of the command and its arguments should be passed in as a list of strings.

We'll now run the `ls` command to list the contents of the `py_logging` directory.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
process_2 = subprocess.run(["ls","py_logging"])
print(process_2)
print(process_2.args)
print(process_2.returncode)
print(process_2.stdout)
~~~

~~~{ caption="Output"}

custom_logger.py  logger.py
CompletedProcess(args=['ls', 'py_logging'], returncode=0)
['ls', 'py_logging']
0
None
~~~

<div class="notice--info">
You can also specify the command as a long string and call Python's `split()` method on it. By default, the `split()` method splits the string on all occurrences of whitespace and returns a list of strings. This list of strings can be used in the call to the `run()` function.

~~~{.python caption=""}
command = ...
command_list = command.split()
~~~

To parse more complex commands‚Äîwhere whitespace is not the correct separator to split on‚Äîuse `shlex.split()` that splits the command string using a shell-like syntax.

~~~{.python caption=""}
import shlex
command = ...
shlex.split(command)
~~~

Let's take an example:

Suppose you'd like to create a directory named 'Foo Bar'. The code cells below show how the command string is split when we use the `split()` method and `shlex.split()`.

~~~{.python caption=">_"}
>>> command_str = "mkdir 'Foo Bar'"
>>> command_str.split()
['mkdir', "'Foo", "Bar'"]
~~~

As seen, the `split()` method splits `command_str` on all whitespaces. When run as a subprocess, the above command will create two directories, `'Foo` and `Bar'`, which is not what we want!

~~~{.python caption=">_"}
>>> import shlex
>>> shlex.split(command_str)
['mkdir', 'Foo Bar']
~~~

Using `shlex.split()` returns the command list `['mkdir', 'Foo Bar']`. Running this command list as a subprocess creates the 'Foo Bar' directory.
</div>

When you set the `shell` parameter to `True`, you can pass in the command as a single string‚Äîwithout splitting it into a list of strings.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
process_3 = subprocess.run("ls py_logging",shell=True)
print(process_3)
print(process_3.args)
print(process_3.stdout)
~~~

~~~{ caption="Output"}
custom_logger.py  logger.py
CompletedProcess(args='ls py_logging', returncode=0)
ls py_logging
None
~~~

<div class="notice--big--primary">
‚ö†Ô∏è If you set `shell = True`, an instance of the underlying shell is used to run the command. Because this is susceptible to [shell injection attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection), avoid setting `shell = True` to run commands that take in user inputs.
</div>

## How to Capture and Redirect Subprocess Outputs

Running `subprocess.run(command)` prints the output of the command onto the console, and the `stdout` attribute is `None` by default if we don't capture the output. When you run Bash commands such as `chmod` to change file permissions or the `sleep` command, you don't need to process the output. However, you may sometimes need to capture the outputs and use them in next steps in your program.

![developer-at-work]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/u7e1tVp.png)\

To capture the output of a command for further processing, you can set the `capture_output` argument to `True` when calling the `run()` function.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
process_4 = subprocess.run("ls",capture_output=True)
print(process_4.stdout)
~~~

Note that the output of `process_4` is not printed onto the console anymore. The `stdout` attribute of the `CompletedProcess` object `process_4` contains the output as a string of bytes.

~~~{.text caption="Output"}
b'py_logging\nmain.py\npy_unit_testing\nstring_manipulation\n'
~~~

You can call the `decode()` method on the value of `stdout` to access the output as a normal Python string.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
process_4 = subprocess.run("ls",capture_output=True)
print(process_4.stdout.decode())
~~~

~~~{ caption="Output"}
py_logging
py_subprocess.py
py_unit_testing
string_manipulation
~~~

If you set `text` to `True`, the output is captured as a Python string, thereby eliminating the need for decoding the `stdout` value.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
process_5 = subprocess.run("ls",capture_output=True,text=True)
print(process_5.stdout)
~~~

~~~{ caption="Output"}
py_logging
py_subprocess.py
py_unit_testing
string_manipulation
~~~

## üìã A Note on Subprocess Pipe

Under the hood, setting `capture_output` to `True` redirects both the output and the errors to `subprocess.PIPE`. Therefore, you can also set `stdout` to `subprocess.PIPE` when calling the `run()` function.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
process_6 = subprocess.run("ls",stdout=subprocess.PIPE,text=True)
print(process_6.stdout)
~~~

~~~{ caption="Output"}
py_logging
main.py
py_unit_testing
string_manipulation
~~~

### How to Redirect Subprocess Output to a File

You can redirect the output of a subprocess to a text file by setting the `stdout` attribute to a valid file object. In this example, the contents of the working directory, including the `contents.txt` file are listed in the `contents.txt` file.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
with open('contents.txt','w') as f_obj:
    subprocess.run("ls",stdout=f_obj,text=True)
~~~

## What Happens When a System Program Fails?

In the examples we've coded thus far, the external programs ran successfully. In practice, we'll run into errors if the external programs do not exist in our development environment or are called with invalid arguments. For example, trying to run a git commit as an external command (subprocess) when I don't have Git installed.

![capture-errors]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/cotwDuk.png)\

The `CompletedProcess` object's `returncode` attribute tells whether or not the execution of the external command was successful. A non-zero `returncode` indicates an error in running the command. The `stderr` attribute contains information on the error.

When we try to list the contents of a directory that doesn't exist, the `returncode` of the `CompletedProcess` object `process_7` is 2 (non-zero) and its `stderr` attribute contains the output as a string of bytes.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
process_7 = subprocess.run(["ls","non-existent-directory"],\
capture_output=True)
print(process_7.returncode)
print(process_7.stderr)
~~~

~~~{.text caption="Output"}
2
b"ls: cannot access 'non-existent-directory': No such file or directory\n"
~~~

You can also capture errors in the `stderr` attribute by explicitly setting the `stderr` argument to `subprocess.PIPE` when calling the `run()` function.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
process_8 = subprocess.run(["ls","non-existent-directory"],\
stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
print(process_8.stderr)
~~~

~~~{ caption="Output"}

b"ls: cannot access 'non-existent-directory': No such file or directory\n"
~~~

To check if the external command ran successfully, here's a summary of methods we've learned so far:

- Check the `returncode` attribute of the `CompletedProcess` object. A non-zero return code indicates that there was an error running the external command.
- Access the `stderr` attribute of the `CompletedProcess` object. The error message in `stderr` has diagnostic information on what went wrong when the external command was run.
- If you anticipate that an external command may fail, you can explicitly set the `stderr` attribute to `subprocess.PIPE` to redirect errors to `stderr`.

In all of the above methods, Python does *not* throw an error when the external command fails. However, it might help to get an error message when running the Python script if the external command fails to run successfully. For this, you can set the optional `check` parameter to `True` in the `run()` function call. If the external command fails to run, Python throws a `CalledProcessError`exception.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}

process_9 = subprocess.run(["ls","non-existent-directory"],\
capture_output=True,check=True)
~~~

~~~{ caption="Output"}

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 38, in <module>
    process_9 = subprocess.run(["ls","non-existent-directory"],\
    capture_output=True,check=True)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/subprocess.py", line 516, in run
    raise CalledProcessError(retcode, process.args,
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['ls', \
'non-existent-directory']' returned non-zero exit status 2.
~~~

### How to Raise a `TimeoutExpired` Exception

![timeout]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/NmPSTon.png)\

We've learned that when a subprocess is invoked, the control is transferred from the parent process (Python script) to the child process that runs the command.

The control returns to the parent process only *after* the child process finishes execution which can sometimes be challenging. For example, the subprocess may involve pinging a URL when you're working offline. In this case, the parent process waits for transfer of control from the child process; but the child process never finishes its execution.

To address this, you can set a `timeout` value (in seconds) when invoking a subprocess. If the subprocess does not finish executing within the value specified by the `timeout` argument, a `TimeoutExpired` exception is raised.

In this example, the Bash command `sleep 10` requires 10 seconds to finish but setting `timeout` to 2 seconds raises the `TimeoutExpired` exception.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}

process10 = subprocess.run(["sleep","10"],capture_output=True,\
check=True,timeout=2)
~~~

~~~{caption="Output"}

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 40, in <module>
    process_10  = subprocess.run(["sleep","10"],capture_output=True,\
    check=True,timeout=2)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/subprocess.py", line 495, in run
    stdout, stderr = process.communicate(input, timeout=timeout)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/subprocess.py", line 1028, in communicate
    stdout, stderr = self._communicate(input, endtime, timeout)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/subprocess.py", line 1869, in _communicate
    self._check_timeout(endtime, orig_timeout, stdout, stderr)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/subprocess.py", line 1072, in _check_timeout
    raise TimeoutExpired(
subprocess.TimeoutExpired: Command '['sleep', '10']' timed \
out after 2 seconds
~~~

The above traceback for the `TimeoutExpired` exception is difficult to parse. We can use Python's `try` and `except` statements to handle the `TimeoutExpired` exception.

The general syntax to use `try-except` statements is as follows:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
try:
    # doing this
except ThisError:
    # do this when ThisError occurs
~~~

When the `TimeoutExpired` exception occurs, we now get a simple error message instead of the hard-to-parse traceback.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
try:
    process10 = subprocess.run(["sleep","10"],capture_output=True,\
    check=True,timeout=2)
except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
    print("subprocess timed out")
~~~

~~~{ caption="Output"}

subprocess timed out
~~~

<div class="notice--info">

### ‚è∞ The `TimeoutExpired` Exception Doesn't Kill the Child Process

The `TimeoutExpired` exception raised‚Äîwhen a subprocess fails to complete executing within a specified duration‚Äîdoes not implicitly kill the child process. If there are many such subprocesses in a Python script, it would help to kill the child processes after they've timed out.

For this, we need to use the `Popen` constructor to run the external command. The `timeout` value is passed to the `communicate()` method when called on the subprocess object. This method returns the `stdout` and `stderr` values as a tuple. When the `TimeoutExpired`exception is raised upon timeout, the child process is killed and the communication is deemed complete.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
p1 = subprocess.Popen(["sleep","10"])
try:
    std_out,std_err = p1.communicate(timeout=1)
except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
    p1.kill()
    std_out,std_err = p1.communicate()
~~~

</div>

## How to Pipe Subprocess Outputs to Inputs of Subprocesses

You may sometimes need to chain commands such that the output of one process is the input to the next command in the chain. We know that we can capture the output of a command in the `stdout` attribute. The `run()` function provides an optional `input` parameter which you can set to the `stdout` of another subprocess. This way, you can pipe subprocess outputs to the input of another subprocess.

Consider the following example, where we'd like to run each of the commands as a subprocess. The output of the first subprocess is the input to the second.

 1. Run the `cat` command to display the contents of [a text file](https://github.com/balapriyac/Python-Subprocesses/blob/main/sample.txt).
 2. Search through the file's contents for the occurrence of a specific string using the `grep` command.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}

process1 = subprocess.run(["cat","sample.txt"],capture_output=True,\
text=True)
process2 = subprocess.run(["grep","-n","Python"],capture_output=True,\
text=True,input=process1.stdout)
print(process_2.stdout)

## How to Change the Environment of a Subprocess

![team-of-developers]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/zfPlWVI.png)\

You can change the [environment](/blog/bash-variables) in which a subprocess runs by setting the `env` parameter to a modified environment. The secondary environment in which a subprocess runs is inherited from the environment of the parent process. This is the default behavior and the `env` parameter is set to its default value `None`. To change this default execution environment, you should set the `env` parameter to the modified environment variable dictionary, when calling the `run()` function.

In Python, the `environ()` function in the `os` module returns the [environment variables](/blog/bash-variables) dictionary. Instead of modifying the underlying environment variables directly, you can create a copy of the dictionary and update one or more environment variables.

In the following example, we update the `PATH` environment variable by adding a new directory and set the `env` parameter to `new_env`.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
import os
new_env = os.environ.copy()
new_env["PATH"] = os.pathsep.join(["/testapp/",new_env["PATH"]])
process_now = subprocess.run(["ls"],env=new_env)
~~~

## Conclusion

I hope this tutorial helped you understand how to use Python's `subprocess` module. Here's a summary of what you've learned.

- To run an external command within a Python script, use `subprocess.run(command)`,  where `command` is a string or a list of strings (when running commands with arguments). The `run()` function returns a `CompletedProcess` object.
- You can set `capture_output = True` to capture the output as a string of bytes in the `stdout` attribute, which you can decode by calling the `decode()` method. Setting `text = True` eliminates the decoding step. You can redirect output to files by setting the `stdout` argument to a valid file object.
- When an external program fails to run, the `returncode` is non-zero and the error information is available in the `stderr` attribute of the `CompletedProcess` object.
- Setting the `check` parameter to `True` raises a `CalledProcessError` when the external command fails. You can optionally set the `timeout` parameter to raise a `TimeoutExpired` exception when the subprocess fails to complete execution within a specified time-frame.
- To change the environment in which a subprocess runs, set the `env` parameter to the modified [environment](/blog/bash-variables). You can update one or more environment variables by creating a copy of the environment variables dictionary.

If you need to run external programs within the Python application, try to run them as subprocesses. You can also leverage Python's threading capabilities to run subprocesses concurrently.

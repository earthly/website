> It’s kind of a cliche, Vlad A. Ionescu, founder and CEO of Earthly, says, but his first attempts to build something really awesome focused on amazing technology. With hindsight, he doesn’t think it’s so surprising that those efforts weren’t successful. It’s not that passion doesn’t matter, but rather that he had to learn to build things that inspired passion from both the market and the builders. 

The Business of Open Source explores the intersection of open source technology with business goals, through conversations with experts in the open source ecosystem. The podcast covers monetizing open source, building an open source startup and how open source drives business value. Formerly Cloud Native Startup.

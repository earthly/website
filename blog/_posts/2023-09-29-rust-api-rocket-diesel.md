**This article provides a guide on creating APIs in Rust using the Rocket framework and Diesel ORM. It explains the setup, configuration, and implementation of CRUD operations in a Rust project, emphasizing practical application through examples.**

Rust is a formidable contender in the backend development scene, drawing attention for its unparalleled emphasis on speed, memory safety, and concurrency. Rust's popularity has propelled it to the forefront of high-performance application development, making it an irresistible choice for those seeking performance and security in their codebase.

Harnessing the full potential of Rust's capabilities entails navigating its expansive ecosystem of libraries and tools, a common pain point new Rust developers face.

In this tutorial, you'll learn about Rust's API development process, focusing on a key player in the Rust web framework arena â€“ Rocket. Rocket is recognized for its concise syntax that simplifies route definition and HTTP request handling. Furthermore, you'll explore Rust's compatibility with various databases, from PostgreSQL to MySQL and SQLite, facilitating seamless data persistence within your applications.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to meet a few prerequisites to understand and follow this hands-on tutorial:

1. You have experience working with Rust and have Rust installed on your machine.
2. Experience working with the Diesel package and SQL databases in Rust is a plus.

Head to [the Rust installations page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust on your preferred operating system.

## Getting Rust Rocket and Diesel

Once you've set up your Rust workspace with [Cargo](https://www.makeuseof.com/cargo-and-crates-with-third-party-packages-in-rust/), add the Rocket and Diesel packages to the `dependencies.toml` file that Cargo created during the project initialization:

~~~{.toml caption="dependencies.toml"}
[dependencies]
diesel = { version = "1.4.5", features = ["sqlite"] }
dotenv = "0.15.0"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
rocket_contrib = "0.4.11"
rocket_codegen = "0.4.11"
rocket = "0.4.11"
serde_derive = "1.0.163"
~~~

You've specified that you want to use version `0.5.4` of the [Rocket crate](https://rocket.rs) and version `1.4.5` of the [Diesel crate](https://diesel.rs) with its `sqlite` feature.

You'll use the `serde` and `serde_json` crates for JSON serialization and deserialization.

Here's the list of imports and directives you'll need to build your API:

~~~{.rs caption="main.rs"}
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

#[macro_use]
extern crate diesel;

use diesel::prelude::*;
use rocket::delete;
use rocket::get;
use rocket::post;
use rocket::put;
use rocket::routes;
use rocket_contrib::json::{Json, JsonValue};
use serde_json::json;

use serde_derive::{Deserialize, Serialize};

use crate::schema::student::dsl::student;

mod schema;
~~~

After importing the necessary types and functions, you can set up your database and build your API.

## Setting Up the Database for Persistence with Diesel

![Database]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/database.png)\

Diesel provides a CLI tool that makes setting up persistence and interacting with the database easier.

Run this command in the terminal of your working directory to install the Diesel CLI tool:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
cargo install diesel_cli --features sqlite
~~~

After installing the tool, create an environment variables file and declare a `DATABASE_URL` variable for your database URL.

Here's a command you can run on your terminal to create the file and insert the database URL for an SQLite database.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
echo DATABASE_URL=database.db > .env
~~~

In this case, `database.db` is the database URL relative to your current working directory since you're using a SQLite in-memory database.

Next, use the `diesel setup` command to set up your database. Diesel will connect to the database to ensure the URL is correct.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
diesel setup
~~~

Then, set up auto migration for easier persistence on the database with the `migration generate` command that takes the table name as an argument. Setting up automatic migrations help with easier database entries.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
diesel migration generate create_students
~~~

On running the command, Diesel will create a directory with two files: `up.sql` and `down.sql`. Executing the `up.sql` file will help create tables and entries, while executing the `down.sql` file will drop the database tables depending on your specification.

Open the `up.sql` file and paste the SQL statement to create your app's table(s).

~~~{.sql caption="up.sql"}
-- Your SQL goes here

CREATE TABLE "students"
(
    "id"         INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    "first_name" TEXT    NOT NULL,
    "last_name"  TEXT    NOT NULL,
    "age"        INTEGER NOT NULL
);
~~~

Add the SQL statement that drops your created tables in the `down.sql` file.

~~~{.sql caption="down.sql"}
-- down.sql

-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql`
DROP TABLE "students"
~~~

After editing the `up.sql` and `down.sql` files, run the `migration run` command to run pending migrations for the database connection.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
diesel migration run
~~~

You'll find a [`schema.rs`](http://schema.rs) file in your project's `src` directory containing code for interacting with the database tables.

~~~{.rs caption="schema.rs"}
// @generated automatically by Diesel CLI.

diesel::table! {
    student (id) {
        id -> Integer,
        first_name -> Text,
        last_name -> Text,
        age -> Integer,
    }
}
~~~

Attach the `schema.rs` file to your `main.rs` file with the `mod schema` directive to use the contents of the  `schema.rs` file in the `main.rs` file.

You must declare structs for data serialization, migrations, and deserialization operations. Create a `models.rs` file and add struct definitions to match your database schema.

Here are the structs for the CRUD operations:

~~~{.rs caption="models.rs"}
#[derive(Queryable, Serialize)]
pub struct Student {
    pub id: i32,
    pub first_name: String,
    pub last_name: String,
    pub age: i32,
}

#[derive(Queryable, Insertable, Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[table_name = "student"]
pub struct NewStudent<'a> {
    pub first_name: &'a str,
    pub last_name: &'a str,
    pub age: i32,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, AsChangeset)]
#[table_name = "student"]
pub struct UpdateStudent {
    first_name: Option<String>,
    last_name: Option<String>,
    age: Option<i32>,
}
~~~

The request handler functions will return the `Student` struct. You'll use the `NewStudent` for data migration and the `UpdateStudent` struct for update operations. The DELETE operation doesn't need a struct since you'll delete entries from the database with the `id`.

Here you've successfully set up the database, and you can start building your API that interacts with the database of Diesel.

Next, you'll write the program for CRUD operations on the database based on incoming requests to the server.

## The POST Request Handler Function

Your POST request handler function will retrieve JSON data from the client, parse the request, insert the data into the database, and return a JSON message to the client after a successful insertion process.

Here's the function signature of the POST request handler function:

~~~{.rs caption="main.rs"}
#[post("/student", format = "json", data = "<new_student>")]
pub fn create_student(new_student: Json<NewStudent>) -> Json<JsonValue> {
   
}
~~~

The `create_student` function takes in a `Json` object of the `NewStudent` type and returns a `Json` object of the `JsonValue` type.

The `#[post("/student", format = "json", data = "<new_student>")]` line is a Rocket attribute that specifies the HTTP method, URL path, and data format for the handler function.

Here's the full function that establishes a database connection and inserts the data into the database:

~~~{.rs caption="main.rs"}
#[post("/student", format = "json", data = "<new_student>")]
pub fn create_student(new_student: Json<NewStudent>) -> Json<JsonValue> {
    let connection = establish_connection();
    let new_student = NewStudent {
        first_name: new_student.first_name,
        last_name: new_student.last_name,
        age: 17,
    };

    diesel::insert_into(crate::schema::student::dsl::student)
        .values(&new_student)
        .execute(&connection)
        .expect("Error saving new student");

    Json(JsonValue::from(json!({
        "status": "success",
        "message": "Student has been created",

    })))
}
~~~

The `connection` variable is the connection instance, and the `new_student` variable is an instance of the `NewStudent` struct containing data from the request.

The `create_student` function inserts the `new_student` struct instance into the database with the `values` method diesel's `insert_into` function before returning the response to the client.

In your `main` function, you'll ignite a rocket instance with the `ignite` function and mount the routes on a base route with the `mount` function that takes in the base route and a list of routes.

Finally, you'll call the `launch` function on your rocket instance to start the server.

~~~{.rs caption="main.rs"}
fn main() {
        rocket::ignite().mount("/", routes![
        create_student,
    ]).launch();
}
~~~

On running your project with the `cargo run` command, the rocket should start a server on port `8000`, and you can proceed to make API calls to your POST request endpoint.

<div class="wide">
![Result from running the server]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/qLvOzrq.jpg)
</div>

Here's a CURL request that sends a POST request with a JSON payload to the `student` endpoint:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/student -H \
'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
'{"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", "age": 17}'
~~~

Here's the result of running the CURL request:

<div class="wide">
![Result from sending the POST request]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/RrobV0A.jpg)
</div>

## The GET Request Handler  Function

Your GET request handler function will return all the entries in the database as JSON to the client.
Here's the function signature of the GET request handler function:

~~~{.rs caption="main.rs"}
#[get("/students")]
pub fn get_students() -> Json<JsonValue> {

}
~~~

The `get_students`  function doesn't take in any values and returns a `Json` object of the `JsonValue` type.

Here's the full function that establishes a database connection and retrieves the data from the database:

~~~{.rs caption="main.rs"}
#[get("/students")]
pub fn get_students() -> Json<JsonValue> {
    let connection = establish_connection();

    let students = student.load::<Student>(&connection)\
    .expect("Error loading students");

    Json(JsonValue::from(json!({
        "students": students,
    })))
}
~~~

The `get_students` function retrieves all the `Student` entries from the database with the `load` function and returns the values with the `json!` macro.

Add the `get_students` function to your `routes!` to register the handler function on the rocket instance and run your application.

~~~{.rs caption="main.rs"}
fn main() {
        rocket::ignite().mount("/", routes![
        get_students,
        create_student,
  
    ]).launch();
}
~~~

On running your app, you should be able to hit the `/student` endpoint with a GET request that retrieves all the entries in the database.

Here's the CURL request that hits the `/student` endpoint and retrieves entries in the database:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
curl http://localhost:8000/students
~~~

Here's the from running the CURL GET request:

<div class="wide">
![Result from sending the GET request]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/FXr2D8W.jpg)
</div>

## The PUT Request Handler Function

Your PUT request handler function will update an entry in the database after searching for the entity with the matching `id` field.

Here's the function signature of the GET request handler function:

~~~{.rs caption="main.rs"}
#[put("/students/<id>", data = "<update_data>")]
pub fn update_student(id: i32, update_data: Json<UpdateStudent>)\
 -> Json<JsonValue> {
  
}
~~~

The `update_student` function takes in the `id` and a `Json` object of the `UpdateStudent` type and returns a `Json` object of the `JsonValue` type.

Here's the full function that establishes a database connection and updates values in the database:

~~~{.rs caption="main.rs"}
#[put("/students/<id>", data = "<update_data>")]
pub fn update_student(id: i32, update_data: Json<UpdateStudent>) ->\
 Json<JsonValue> {
    let connection = establish_connection();

    // Use the `update` method of the Diesel ORM to update 
    // the student's record
    let _updated_student = diesel::update(student.find(id))
        .set(&update_data.into_inner())
        .execute(&connection)
        .expect("Failed to update student");

    // Return a JSON response indicating success
    Json(JsonValue::from(json!({
        "status": "success",
        "message": format!("Student {} has been updated", id),
    })))
}
~~~

After establishing the connection with the `establish_connection` function, the `update_student` function updates the entity in the database with the value from the `update_data` parameter after searching for a matching `id` with the `find` function.
The `update_student` function returns a message containing the ID of the updated entity after a successful operation.

Add the `update_students` function to your `routes!` to register the handler function on the rocket instance and run your application.

~~~{.rs caption="main.rs"}
fn main() {
        rocket::ignite().mount("/", routes![
        get_students,
        create_student,
        update_student,
    ]).launch();
}
~~~

On running your app, you should be able to hit the `/students/<id>` endpoint with a PUT request that updates the entity that has the specified `id` value.

Here's a CURL request that sends a `PUT` request to the server:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/students/1 -H \
'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
'{"first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Doe", "age": 18}'
~~~

Here's the result of the update operation attempt for the row with the `id` equal to 1.

<div class="wide">
![Result from sending the PUT request]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/ZSVGidf.jpg)
</div>

## The DELETE Request Handler Function

Your DELETE request handler function will delete an entry from the database after searching for the entity with the matching `id` field.

Here's the function signature of the DELETE request handler function:

~~~{.rs caption="main.rs"}
#[delete("/students/<id>")]
pub fn delete_student(id: i32) -> Json<JsonValue> {
        
}
~~~

The `delete_student` function takes in the `id`  of the entity you want to delete and returns a `Json` object of the `JsonValue` type.

Here's the full function that establishes a database connection and deletes values from the database:

~~~{.rs caption="main.rs"}
#[delete("/students/<id>")]
pub fn delete_student(id: i32) -> Json<JsonValue> {
    let connection = establish_connection();

    diesel::delete(student.find(id)).execute(&connection)./
    expect(&format!("Unable to find student {}", id));

    Json(JsonValue::from(json!({
        "status": "success",
        "message": format!("Student with ID {} has been deleted", id),
    })))
}
~~~

The `delete_student` function deletes the entity from the database with the `delete` function after searching for the entity with the `find` function.

The `delete_student` function returns a message containing the ID of the deleted entity after a successful operation.

Add the `delete_student` function to your `routes!` to register the handler function on the rocket instance and run your application.

~~~{.rs caption="main.rs"}
fn main() {
        rocket::ignite().mount("/", routes![
        get_students,
        delete_student,
        create_student,
        update_student,
    ]).launch();
}
~~~

On running your app, you should be able to hit the `/students/<id>` endpoint with a DELETE request that deletes the entity that has the specified `id` value.

Here's a CURL request that sends a `DELETE` request to the `/students/<id>` endpoint on the server:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/students/1
~~~

Here's the result of the delete operation attempt for the row with the `id` equal to 1:

<div class="wide">
![Result from sending the delete request]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/VYsP2gG.jpg)
</div>

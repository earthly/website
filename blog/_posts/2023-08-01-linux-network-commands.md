## Basic Networking Concepts

![Concepts]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/concepts.png)\

In this section, we will discuss the fundamental networking concepts that form the basis of networking in Linux.

### Understanding TCP/IP Protocol Stack

Although the [Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/) model provides a conceptual and structured way to understand network communication. [The TCP/IP protocol stack](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cyber-security-tutorial/what-is-tcp-ip-model) is the foundation of modern networking and serves as the backbone for communication on the internet.

Imagine you want to message a friend who lives far away. To make sure your message reaches them correctly, the internet defines a set of rules and steps your message must follow. The rules here refer to the TCP/IP protocol.

<div class="wide">
![TCP/IP protocol stack vs the OSI reference model]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/n6vOgde.png)
</div>

The TCP/IP protocol stack consists of four layers, each serving a specific purpose in the transmission of data across a network. Let's clarify each layer in the stack:

* **Application Layer**: The topmost layer of the TCP/IP stack, responsible for application-level protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.

* **Transport Layer**: Ensures data delivery across the network. The two key protocols at this layer are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

* **Internet Layer**: Handles data packet addressing, routing, and fragmentation. The Internet Protocol(IP) is implemented at this layer.

* **Network Interface Layer**: Also known as the Link Layer, deals with the physical transmission of data over the network medium. This layer includes Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Point-to-Point Protocol(PPP).

Understanding the protocol stack lets you comprehend how data is encapsulated, addressed, and transmitted across a network. It also helps you troubleshoot network issues, as it helps identify the layer a problem exists.

To gain more knowledge about network protocols and their workings, take advantage of the various [resources available online](https://www.comptia.org/content/guides/what-is-a-network-protocol).

### Linux Network Interfaces and Configuration

Network interfaces are the physical or virtual components through which a Linux system communicates with the network. Network interfaces provide a means for devices to send and receive data packets over a network.

Let's explore the three common types of network interfaces:

* **Ethernet Interfaces**: The most common type of network interface used for wired connections. They have unique MAC addresses and are configured with IP addresses, netmasks, and gateways.

* **Wireless Interfaces**: Used for wireless network connections. They require configuring SSIDs (Service Set Identifiers), encryption keys, and authentication settings.

* **Virtual Interfaces**: Virtual network interfaces, such as VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) and virtual tunnels (like VPN connections), allow for segmentation and secure communication over networks.

Linux systems store network configuration details in files like `/etc/network/interfaces` or `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>`. These files define IP addresses, netmask, gateway, DNS servers, and more.

Although not covered in detail here you can [read up](https://www.dipolnet.com/what_is_the_ip_address_network_mask_gateway__bib538.htm) to gain more knowledge of netmasks, gateways, and DNS in the context of Linux systems.

Understanding network interfaces and their configuration is crucial for setting up and managing network connectivity.

## Essential Linux Networking Commands

In this section, we will see essential Linux networking commands that allow you to configure, monitor, and troubleshoot network connections.

### Packet Internet Groper - `ping`

`ping` is a network diagnostic tool used to test the connectivity between two devices on a network. It sends a small packet of data (echo request) to a specified IP address or hostname and measures the time it takes for the packet to reach the destination and return (echo reply).

* **Syntax**: `ping [options] <destination>`

* **Common options**: `-c`(count), `-s`(packet size), `-i`(interval), and `-t`(ttl).

* **Command**: ping with interval.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
ping -i 2 google.com
~~~

<div class="wide">
![`ping` command output]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/LNBRQPE.png)
</div>  

The command continuously sends Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo requests at intervals (`-i 2`) to the specified destination (`google.com`) and displays the round-trip time for each response received from the destination.

### Interface Configuration - `ifconfig`

The `ifconfig` command enables the configuration of network interfaces. It provides various functionalities such as displaying the current configuration, assigning an IP address, and modifying the parameters of a network interface.

* **Syntax**: `ifconfig <interface> [options]`

* **Common options**: `up`, `down`, `add`, `del`, `netmask`, and `-v`(verbose).

* **Command**: Configure both IP address and netmask simultaneously.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
ifconfig enp2s0 197.210.55.20 netmask 255.255.255.0
~~~

The command assigns the IP address, `197.210.55.20` to the interface, `enp2s0`, along with the netmask, `255.255.255.0`. This ensures communication within the specified network.

### Internet Protocol - `ip`

The `ip` command is preferred for configuring network interfaces on modern Linux distributions. It is more powerful and flexible than the `ifconfig` command and offers more advanced networking functionalities.

* **Syntax**: `ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }`

* **Useful commands**: `ip link`, `ip address`, `ip route`, `ip rule`, `ip monitor`

* **Command**: Remove an IP address from a network interface.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
ip address del 192.168.82.100/24 dev enp2s0
~~~

The `ip address del` command removes the specified IP address (`192.168.82.100/24`) from the interface (`enp2s0`). This disassociates the IP from the interface and prevents it from being used for network communication.

### Network Statistics - `netstat`

`netstat` is a versatile networking utility that offers comprehensive information on network connections, routing tables, and network statistics. Its functionality facilitates monitoring and troubleshooting of various network-related activities on your system.

netstat -c
~~~

<div class="wide">
![`netstat` command output]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/XfXlOl8.png)
</div>

The command continuously (`-c`) displays the network connection status, including open ports, active connections, and network traffic information. The output updates dynamically, allowing you to monitor the network activity on your system in real time.

### Managing Routing Tables - `route`

The `route` command lets you view and manipulate the IP routing table. The IP routing table determines how network traffic is directed and forwarded between different networks or hosts.

* **Syntax**: `route [options] [command] <destination>`

* **Common options**: `add`, `del`, `-net`, `-v`(verbose) and `-n`(numeric values).

* **Command**: Add a route to a network.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
route add -net 198.166.0.0/24 gw 10.0.0.1
~~~

The command configures the routing table to direct network traffic destined for the `198.166.0.0/24` network to the gateway `10.0.0.1`. This ensures that network packets intended for the specified network are correctly forwarded through the appropriate gateway.

### Tracing the Path to a Destination - `traceroute`

The `traceroute` command traces the route packets take from a source to a destination over a network. It provides information about the number of hops (intermediate devices) between the source and destination and the round-trip time (latency) for each hop.

* **Syntax**: `traceroute [options] destination`

* **Useful options**: `-n`(numeric addresses), `-p`(destination port), `--debug`, and `-m`(maximum_ttl).

* **Command**: Traceroute with maximum hops and specific probe count.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
traceroute -m 30 -q 3 google.com
~~~

<div class="wide">
![`traceroute` command output]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/HpSRvTn.png)
</div>

The command traces the packet's path from the source to the destination (`google.com`) while showing the IP addresses of intermediate devices and their round-trip time. The `-m 30` option limits the hops to 30, and `-q 3` specifies the number of probes per hop. This helps identify the network path and measure latency between the source and destination.

### Domain Information Groper - `dig`

`dig` is a powerful DNS (Domain Name System) tool used to perform DNS queries and retrieve DNS-related information. It provides detailed information about DNS records, name servers, and DNS resolution.

* **Syntax**: `dig [options] [domain]`

* **Common query options**; `+short`(short form of information), `trace`(trace DNS delegation), `+recurse`(recursive mode)

* **Command**: DNS query with trace.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
dig +trace google.com
~~~

<div class="wide">
![`dig` command with trace output]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/dgDyiSN.png)
</div>

The command traces(`+trace`) and shows the DNS resolution process from root DNS servers to authoritative DNS servers. The output includes detailed DNS records and IP addresses associated with the domain (`google.com`). This command aids in troubleshooting DNS issues and understanding the domain's DNS infrastructure.

### Configuring Firewall Rules - `iptables`

`iptables` is a [firewall utility](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cyber-security-tutorial/what-is-firewall) that allows you to configure and manage the netfilter firewall rules. It provides a flexible framework for filtering and manipulating network traffic, enabling network administrators to set up rules to control incoming and outgoing connections.

* **Syntax**: `iptables [options] [table] <command> [chain] [rulespec]`

* **Common options**: `--append`, `--delete`, `--source`, `--destination`, and `--jump`.

* **Command**: Delete a rule from the firewall.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
iptables --delete INPUT -s 192.168.0.10 -j DROP
~~~

The command removes the rule that **DROP**s incoming network traffic from the specified source IP address, `192.168.0.10` in the target chain, `INPUT`. This enables control over network traffic based on various criteria.

These commands form the foundation for effective network control and troubleshooting in Linux.

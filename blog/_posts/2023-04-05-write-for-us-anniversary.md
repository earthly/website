### 1. Select a Topic

After you apply, we'll review your writing samples and if we think it's a good fit, we'll get started with selecting a topic.

We take suggestions, so you'll be able to pitch us any ideas you have.

<div class="notice--info">
A pitch topic is an article title, a paragraph sample introduction, and an outline. Digital Ocean has a great guide on writing an [article proposal](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-write-a-proposal-and-outline-for-a-digitalocean-community-tutorial)

We also post topics in our Slack Channel that we are interested in having writers work on, and you'll be free to select from those as well.

#### The Edit Process

An article will go through up to two rounds of editing, via google docs. We suggest reading your article out-loud, and run it through grammarly.com before submitting it, to weed out any simple mistakes.

( Make sure your document markdown in a google doc and world editable. )

First time authors should expect to spend some time responding to edits and updating the article.

Articles that don't reach our publishing standards will not be published.

Writers are paid upon article publication.

### 4. Get Paid

We will pay you $350 USD for your article and use our Twitter account to promote your article to our audience of developers.

After your article has been accepted please send us an invoice. Invoice should include the following: Date, Title of Article, Amount, Bank name, Back account number/IBAN, Routing Number/SWIFT code/ABA.

It's been a year since we started [taking outside submissions](/blog/write-for-us) to the Earthly blog, and we just wanted to take the time to celebrate and say thank you to all the writers who've contributed!

![thank-you]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/thankyou.png)\

In the last year, we've had the privilege of working with over **25 talented tech writers** on over **70 technical tutorials**! And this year we're on track to double those numbers. So thank you to all the writers and editors who made this possible. We're thrilled with the quality of the content we've been able to put out, and we look forward to another great year of helping developers learn and solve problems.

## Come Join Us

If you're an **experienced technical writer** looking to expand your audience and get paid doing it, we'd love to hear from you! Our blog gets over 175k visitors a month, and we're still growing.

If you're a **beginner writer** who is **eager to learn and improve**, we want to hear from you too! Our editors work hard with writers to help them level up their technical writing abilities.

Here are just a couple of comments to our editors from writers we've worked with recently:

## Process

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

### 1. Select a Topic

After you apply, we'll review your writing samples and if we think it's a good fit, we'll get started with selecting a topic.

We take suggestions, so you'll be able to pitch us any ideas you have.

<div class="notice--info">
A pitch topic is an article title, a paragraph sample introduction, and an outline. Digital Ocean has a great guide on writing an [article proposal](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-write-a-proposal-and-outline-for-a-digitalocean-community-tutorial)
</div>

We also post topics in our Slack Channel that we are interested in having writers work on, and you'll be free to select from those as well.

### 2. Write a Draft

Write your draft in a Google Doc, using Markdown.

<div class="notice--info">
  Articles should be at least 1500 words and follow Draft.dev's excellent [style guide](https://draft.dev/learn/styleguide). Notably, the draft should be in a google doc, in markdown, with images hosted on [imgur](https://bit.ly/3EvKhS1).
</div>

### 3. Get Published

Once your draft is approved, we'll let you know when it will be coming out on the blog.

<div class="notice--info">

#### The Edit Process

An article will go through up to two rounds of editing, via google docs. We suggest reading your article out-loud, and run it through grammarly.com before submitting it, to weed out any simple mistakes.

( Make sure your document markdown in a google doc and world editable. )

First time authors should expect to spend some time responding to edits and updating the article.

Articles that don't reach our publishing standards will not be published.

Writers are paid upon article publication.

</div>

### 4. Get Paid

We will pay you $350 USD for your article and use our Twitter account to promote your article to our audience of developers.

<div class="notice--info">

After your article has been accepted please send us an invoice. Invoice should include the following: Date, Title of Article, Amount, Bank name, Back account number/IBAN, Routing Number/SWIFT code/ABA.

If you need help with invoicing or have other questions about payment, please feel free to reach out.

If your main job is writing [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/), you probably spend too much time creating and editing Dockerfiles and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) configurations. Maybe you've already created some template files to save some time, but in the end, it doesn't help much because plain files have static content, and no project is the same.

The [`docker init`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/init/) command, which was introduced with [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) 4.18, promises to be a faster and more flexible way of setting up a new Dockerfile. If successful, it could become the new standard way of initializing a container-based project.

With `docker init`, generating files for Docker and Docker Compose only takes a few seconds. Even if you have complex configuration requirements, `docker init` lets you start with a useful default configuration.

In this article, you'll learn all about `docker init` and how to use it to speed up Dockerizing a Go app.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have basic knowledge of Go, Docker, Dockerfiles, and Docker Compose. If you want to follow along, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- A [Go toolchain](https://go.dev/dl)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) 4.18 or later

## Docker Init: A Versatile Container Configuration Generator

Before Docker Init came into existence, turning a Go project into a containerized application was fraught with repetitive tasks: create a Dockerfile, list the standard steps, create a Docker Compose configuration, and so on.

For a quick test setup, you could get away with writing a basic Dockerfile, like so:

~~~{.dockerfile caption="Dockerfile"}
ARG GO_VERSION=1.21.3
FROM golang:{% raw %}${GO_VERSION}{% endraw %}
WORKDIR /src

COPY . . 

RUN go mod download -x

RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o /bin/server.

EXPOSE 7890

ENTRYPOINT [ "/bin/server" ]
~~~

Even though this is a super minimal Dockerfile, it's boring and repetitive to have to write the same type of file over and over again.

Moreover, this Dockerfile leaves a lot to be desired:

- The final image contains the complete Go toolchain and the project's source code.
- The `golang` Docker image might use an OS image that you don't want or need in the final image. (A $64 question: what OS image is the `golang` image based on?)
- The Dockerfile does not take care of basic setup tasks such as installing up-to-date TLS certificates.
- The Dockerfile doesn't create a nonprivileged user to run the app under. You wouldn't want to run your app as `root` even inside a container, right?

Taking all of these requirements into account, the Dockerfile would be extensive and would take a long time to write. There would also be plenty of occasions to introduce subtle bugs that might be hard to spot, let alone track down.

### Let Docker Init Do the Tedious Work

With Docker Init, everything changes. Docker Init is a language-aware Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration generator that can inspect your project to determine the proper settings for the Dockerfile to be generated.

If you run `docker init` with no parameters, it goes into interactive mode and asks you to enter or select a few language-specific details. It automatically determines suitable default settings from your app, such as the language of your project (Go), the installed Go version, and even details like the HTTP port your app uses. You can choose to overwrite the suggested values, but the default values are usually adequate.

From your input, Docker Init generates the following:

- A multistage Dockerfile that builds and runs your app
- A `compose.yaml` file for Docker Compose
- A `.dockerignore` file with an extensive list of files to ignore

Generating these files instead of writing them from scratch not only saves time but also provides you with a stable container configuration out of the box.

The current version of Docker Init always runs in interactive mode. The only available command line parameters are `--help` and `--version`. The focus is definitely on ease of use.

Docker Init currently knows five languages: Go, Python, Node.js, Rust, and ASP.NET. If you want a Dockerfile for a different language, Docker Init can still generate a Dockerfile and a `compose.yaml` file with decent defaults.

## How to Use Docker Init with Go

Now that you know a little more about Docker Init, it's time to walk through the process of turning a Go web server project into a containerized app.

Imagine that it's Friday afternoon, and your task this week has been to write a sophisticated web app.

To do so, you create a new Go project in an empty folder by calling the following:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
go mod init mywebapp
~~~

Then, you create a `main.go` file with the following content:

~~~{.go caption="main.go"}
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, `<h1>Hello, World! <span style="color:#55D7E5">ʕ◔ϖ◔ʔ</span></h1>`)
    })

    log.Println("Listening on http://localhost:7890")
    log.Println(http.ListenAndServe(":7890", nil))
}
~~~

To make sure all your dependencies are up to date, you run this:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
go mod tidy
~~~

As you'll see later, the generated Dockerfile creates bind mounts to `go.mod` *and* `go.sum`. However, the Go toolchain does not generate a `go.sum` file if it's not necessary. Therefore, you need to create an empty `go.mod` file to make the Dockerfile succeed, like this:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
touch go.sum
~~~

You implement a test run of the app:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
go run .
~~~

Then, you point your browser to `http://localhost:7890` and see a "Hello, World!" message.

You've just finished the test when a salesperson enters the room and asks, "Is the web app ready? Our client just dropped by and wants to get a quick demo."

The demo environment requires a containerized app, but you know that with `docker init` you'll only need a minute to create the necessary container files.

### Run Docker Init

To containerize the app, all you need to do is `cd` into the project directory and ensure that everything is there:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ cd webapp
$ ls
go.mod     go.sum     main.go
~~~

Then, type the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
$ docker init
~~~

This command starts `docker init` in interactive mode and presents a list of application platforms to choose from:

<div class="wide">
![Docker Init CLI start screen]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/hDzhuRD.png)
</div>

Select **Go** and hit **Enter**.

Then, Docker Init will ask you which Go version to use:

<div class="wide">
![Docker Init offers to enter a Go version]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Q3aJPYL.png)
</div>

Specify the Go version as `1.M.m`, where `M` is the major version and `m` is the minor version (*eg* Go 1.21.3). If you create the Dockerfile for testing, you can also use the string `latest` instead of the version number. Docker will then use the latest `golang` image at the time the Dockerfile is processed.

**Please note:** The version string should *not* contain a leading `v`, such as `v1.21.3`. The format with a `v` prefix is used by the Go toolchain, whereas the Go version you enter here specifies the version of the `golang` image. Therefore, you need to follow the Docker version syntax.

Next, specify the path of your main package relative to the current directory where you invoked `docker init`:

<div class="wide">
![Enter the path of the main package]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/2qZuV7k.png)
</div>

Finally, specify the port your server listens on:

<div class="wide">
![Specify the server port]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/kerStSz.png)
</div>

Note that the provided port number is the one that the web app code uses. `docker init` searches the app's source code for data like the Go version or a port number to present this data as suitable default values. This is not only convenient but also removes a possible source of errors.

After all the settings are confirmed, `docker init` creates a Dockerfile, a `compose.yaml` file, and a `.dockerignore` file, and provides instructions on how to run the app:

<div class="wide">
![Docker Init has generated all files]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/hy3ffJ7.png)
</div>

Now, start the app with `docker compose up --build`, and your browser will show the "Hello, World!" message again at `https://localhost:7890`.

Move the Docker image to the demo environment, and you'll make the salesperson incredibly grateful. Your weekend plans are safe.

### A Brief Look at the Generated Files

As mentioned above, Docker Init generates three files: a Dockerfile, a `compose.yaml` file, and a `.dockerignore` file. Depending on the project, you might need to go through the files to adjust or amend settings, so it's a good idea to get familiar with the details of the files as `docker init` generates them.

#### The Dockerfile

The generated Dockerfile contains two stages: `build` and `final`.

In the `build` stage, Docker uses the `golang` image to download all dependencies and build the app binary. In the `final` stage, Docker:

- Sets up an Alpine Linux image
- Downloads TLS certificates
- Creates a non-root user
- Copies the app binary over from the `build` stage
- Sets the exposed port and the entry point for your app

In addition, `docker init` generously adds comments to all the steps and actions so that even Docker newcomers can quickly navigate their way through the build steps:

~~~{.dockerfile caption="Dockerfile"}
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

#### The Docker Compose File

Most containerized apps are composed of multiple components that live in separate containers. `docker init` generates a Docker Compose file that lets you easily add dependencies such as a database or a proxy server.

The default `compose.yaml` defines a single service: your app. Like the Dockerfile, the compose file contains extensive comments, including an example configuration for adding a PostgreSQL database, defining a volume, and setting secrets:

~~~{.yaml caption="compose.yaml"}
# Comments are provided throughout this file to help you get started.
# If you need more help, visit the Docker compose reference guide at
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/

# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
      target: final
    ports:
      - 7890:7890

# The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
# database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
# start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
# database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
# to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
# a password of your choosing to it before running `docker compose up`.
#     depends_on:
#       db:
#         condition: service_healthy
#   db:
#     image: postgres
#     restart: always
#     user: postgres
#     secrets:
#       - db-password
#     volumes:
#       - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
#     environment:
#       - POSTGRES_DB=example
#       - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
#     expose:
#       - 5432
#     healthcheck:
#       test: [ "CMD", "pg_isready" ]
#       interval: 10s
#       timeout: 5s
#       retries: 5
# volumes:
#   db-data:
# secrets:
#   db-password:
#     file: db/password.txt
~~~

#### The `.dockerignore` File

The third file that `docker init` generates is a `.dockerignore` file with a sensible default list of files that should not be copied into the container image.

If your Go build process is more complex than a simple `go build`, you'll want to review the output for artifacts that should stay out of the image and add them here:

~~~{ caption=".dockerignore"}
# Include any files or directories that you don't want to be copied to your
# container here (e.g., local build artifacts, temporary files, etc.).
#
# For more help, visit the .dockerignore file reference guide at
# https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file

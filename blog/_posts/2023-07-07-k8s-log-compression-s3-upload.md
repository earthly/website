Logs are essential for monitoring and troubleshooting modern applications in a Kubernetes environment. However, as applications generate more logs, managing them can become a challenge. The storage costs can quickly add up, and retrieving relevant logs from multiple locations can be time-consuming and inefficient. To solve this problem, log compression and periodic uploading to a centralized location like AWS S3 can help reduce storage costs and make log retrieval much easier. Kubernetes CronJobs offers a powerful way to automate these tasks, allowing you to compress and upload logs at scheduled intervals with ease.

In this article, you'll explore how to use Kubernetes CronJobs to manage logs in a Kubernetes environment and also dive into using Kubernetes CronJobs to set up and configure log compression and uploading to AWS S3.

By the end of this article, you'll have a clear understanding of how to use Kubernetes CronJobs to automate the management of logs in a Kubernetes environment, reducing storage costs and making log retrieval more efficient.

## Prerequisites

To follow along in this tutorial, you should have the following:

- A basic understanding of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs) and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on your machine.
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) installed on your machine, and a running Kubernetes Cluster already created (any number of nodes works fine).
- An AWS S3 bucket already created - this tutorial utilizes a pre-existing bucket named `postgres-database-logs`.
- An AWS IAM user with permission to interact with the S3 bucket.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your machine, a DockerHub account, and a public repository already set up. The public repository will be used to host the Docker image of our script and will make it publicly accessible. This allows Kubernetes to pull the image from the repository without needing additional credentials or access permissions - This tutorial uses a repository called *logs-cronjob*.

## Setting Up the Environment

To implement log compression and uploading to AWS S3 with Kubernetes CronJobs, several steps must be implemented to set up the necessary environment. In this section, we will walk through the process of setting up the environment for our implementation. This includes creating a Kubernetes Statefulset for PostgreSQL, verifying the Statefulset, and creating an S3 bucket in AWS for compressed log files.

<div class="notice--info">
ðŸ’¡Stateful applications, such as databases, are deployed and managed in Kubernetes using resources called [StatefulSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/). For database systems to guarantee data consistency and durability, they provide stable and distinct network identities, orderly deployment, and scaling, and stable storage for each instance.
</div>

Create a `database` namespace with the following `kubectl` command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl create ns database
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating and viewing namespace (*database*)]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/gXAz5QU.png)
</div>

Execute the following line of code to create a Kubernetes secret object in the `databse` namespace. This Kubernetes secret will store a username and password for the PostgreSQL database securely. This is the secret we'll use in our PostgreSQL Statefulset, later on, to authenticate with the PostgreSQL database server.:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl create -n database secret generic postgres-secret \
--from-literal=username=admin --from-literal=password=123456
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating secret (*postgres-secret*)]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/boolvGr.png)
</div>

Create a file `postgres-statefulset.yaml` and paste in the following configuration settings to create a Kubernetes Statefulset object for a PostgreSQL database with two replicas:

~~~{.yaml caption="postgres-statefulset.yaml"}
#postgres-statefulset.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet 
metadata:
  name: postgres
spec:
  serviceName: postgres
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: postgres 
  replicas: 2 
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: postgres 
    spec:
      containers: 
        - name: postgres 
          image: postgres  
          imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
          env: 
          - name: POSTGRES_USER
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef: 
                name: postgres-secret
                key: username 
          - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD 
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: postgres-secret
                key: password
          ports:
          - containerPort: 5432 
~~~

Let's go through each section of the above YAML file:

- `apiVersion`: Specifies the API version used for the Kubernetes resource.
- `kind`: Defines the resource type as a `StatefulSet` for managing stateful applications.
- `metadata`: Sets the unique name of the StatefulSet resource to `postgres`.
- `spec`: Specifies the name of the associated Kubernetes service which is named `postgres` in this case.
- `selector`: Defines the labels used to select the Pods that the StatefulSet should manage..
- `replicas`: Sets the desired number of pod replicas to `2`.
- `template`: Describes the pod template used to create the actual pods.
- `metadata`: Contains labels used to identify the Pods (app: postgres).
- `labels`: Defines the label for the pod template, ensuring that pods created from this template are assigned the label `app: postgres`.
- `spec`: Defines the specification of the Pods.
  - `containers`: Contains a list of containers within the pod. In this case, this pod will only contain one container.
    - `name`: Specifies the name of the container as `postgres`.
    - `image`: Specifies the container image to be used. Which in this case is the official `postgres` [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).
    - `imagePullPolicy`: Defines the [image pull policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#image-pull-policy) for the container. In our case, it is set to `IfNotPresent` which means the image is pulled only if it is not already present locally.
    - `env`: This section defines environment variables for the container. In our case, we set an environment variable `POSTGRES_USER` with a value retrieved from a key `username` within a secret. The secret is the `postgres-secret` we created earlier.
Also, we set another environment variable `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` from the same secret and retrieve the value of the key `password`.
- `ports`: Specifies the container's port configuration.
- `containerPort`: Sets the port number `5432` to be exposed by the container, which is the default port for PostgreSQL.

Execute the following commands to create and view the Statefulset resource:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl apply -n database -f postgres-statefulset.yaml  
kubectl get statefulsets -n database 
kubectl get pods -n database
~~~

These commands will create a Statefulset and then list all Statefulsets and pods in the cluster within the `database` namespace, respectively.

The image below shows that the Postgres StatefulSet is being created with the `2` replicas (pods) up and running:

<div class="wide">
![Creating and viewing Statefulset (*postgres*)]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/1GfxYOA.png)
</div>

When interacting with a PostgreSQL server running as a StatefulSet in a Kubernetes cluster, we need to create a [service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) to expose it. You can create a Kubernetes service through the below YAML configuration file. You can create a file *postgres-service.yaml* and paste into it the following configuration settings:

~~~{.yaml caption="postgres-service.yaml"}
#postgres-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: postgres-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: postgres
  ports:
    - name: postgres
      port: 5432
      targetPort: 5432
~~~

This will create a service named `postgres-service` to expose the Postgres StatefulSet within the Kubernetes cluster to listen on port `5432` and forward traffic to the same port on the target pods.

Execute the following command to create the Kubernetes service:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl apply -f postgres-service.yaml -n database
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Creating and viewing Postgres Service]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/PTGyrRH.png)
</div>

Now, the Postgres Statefulset is exposed internally - inside the Kubernetes Cluster - and we can interact with it through the service we just created.

## Scripting and Dockerization

Since we have set up the environment and created a Statefulset for the PostgreSQL database, the next step is to create a script using NodeJS, that will enable us to programmatically retrieve, compress, and upload the logs to a centralized location such as AWS S3.

<div class="notice--info">
ðŸ’¡ This tutorial uses NodeJS to write the script, you can use any programming language you are conversant with.
</div>

First, we will write a script using the [Node.js Kubernetes client library](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/javascript) to retrieve logs from the PostgreSQL Statefulset programmatically. Next, we will write a script to compress the logs for storage efficiency. Finally, we will write a script using the [AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) to upload the compressed logs to AWS S3.

Once the scripts have been written and tested, we will containerize them using Docker to create a portable and easily distributable solution.

Create a working directory with the following command and change the directory to it:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
mkdir cronjob
cd cronjob
~~~

Initialize a NodeJS project and install the NodeJS Kubernetes client library with the following commands:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
npm init -y
npm install @kubernetes/client-node
~~~

This will provide a set of APIs and tools to interact with Kubernetes clusters programmatically using Node.js, and will also allow us to manage Kubernetes resources, perform operations like creating, updating, and deleting objects, and retrieve information about our cluster.

<div class="wide">
![Initializing Node project and installing Kubernetes client library]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Uvc9C5S.png)
</div>

Execute the following command to install the AWS SDK for JavaScript module that provides functionality for working with Amazon S3, specifically the `@aws-sdk/client-s3` module:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Installing aws SDK for javascript]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/KBunk8m.png)
</div>

Once you have AWS SDK installed, follow these instructions to proceed to the next step:

- Create a file named `index.js` in your current working directory. This file will serve as the main location for our script.

- Locate the `package.json` file in your working directory. This file was automatically created when we initialized our NodeJS project using the `npm init -y` command.

- Open up the `package.json` file and make the edits to match the following configuration below:

~~~{.js caption="package.json"}
#package.json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  ...
}
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Editing `package.json` file]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/nIPaegf.png)
</div>

Doing this will set the `index.js` file as the main entry point and set the script to run with the `npm start` command.

Now refer to the following URL from [github](https://github.com/mercybassey/a-script-to-compress-logs-from-kubernetes-and-upload-to-aws-s3/blob/main/index.js) to get the full NodeJS script and paste it into the `index.js` file.

Here's a brief explanation of what each section in the code does:

- First, we import the libraries needed for our script to run successfully which are the AWS SDK for JavasScript V3, the `gzipSync` function from the Node.js [`zlib`](https://nodejs.org/api/zlib.html) library and the Kubernetes client for Node.js. Then we load the Kubernetes configuration from a file named `cronjob-kubeconfig.yaml`.

<div class="notice--info">
ðŸ’¡In this scenario, you need to create a file called `cronjob-kubeconfig.yaml` that contains your cluster's *kubeconfig* (i.e the information about your Kubernetes cluster, such as the API server address, authentication credentials, and cluster context) in your working directory.

Doing this will ensure that the script can locate and load the configuration settings for your Kubernetes cluster correctly. You have the flexibility to choose any name for this file according to your preference.
</div>

~~~{.js caption="index.js"}

const { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-s3");
const { gzipSync } = require("zlib");
const k8s = require("@kubernetes/client-node");

const kc = new k8s.KubeConfig();
kc.loadFromFile("./cronjob-kubeconfig.yaml");
~~~

- Secondly, we create instances of the Kubernetes API clients for `AppsV1Api` and `CoreV1Api` by defining the Kubernetes namespace from which the logs will be retrieved which is in this case called `database`, the name of the StatefulSet `postgres`, and the name of the compressed log file.

~~~{.js caption="index.js"}
const k8sApi = kc.makeApiClient(k8s.AppsV1Api);
const coreApi = kc.makeApiClient(k8s.CoreV1Api);
const namespace = "database"; 
// Define the namespace where the logs will be retrieved from

const statefulSetName = "postgres"; 

const compressedLogFilename = `${statefulSetName}-logs-` \
+ new Date().toISOString() + ".gz";
~~~

Also, we initialize an instance of the AWS S3 client with our specified AWS region and access credentials. And then, define the name of the S3 bucket where the compressed log file will be uploaded.

~~~{.js caption="index.js"}
const s3 = new S3Client({
  region: "YOUR_REGION", 
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: 'ACCESS_KEY_ID',
    secretAccessKey: 'SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
  },
});

const bucketName = "postgres-database-logs"; 
~~~

<div class="notice--info">
Be sure to replace the following `REGION`, `ACCESS_ID` and `SECRET_ACCESS_ID` with your own data.
</div>

Next, we define an asynchronous function `retrieveLogs()` to retrieve logs from all pods in the `postgres` StatefulSet. We then fetch the StatefulSet object, extract the pod labels, and list the pods using those labels. After that, we iterate over the pods and retrieve their logs; then we compress and upload them to our pre-existing S3 bucket using the AWS SDK for JavaScript. Finally, we log a success message for each pod indicating that its logs have been uploaded.

~~~{.js caption="index.js"}
async function retrieveLogs() {
  
  const statefulSet = await k8sApi.readNamespacedStatefulSet\
  (statefulSetName, namespace);
  const podLabels = statefulSet.body.spec.selector.matchLabels;


  const pods = await coreApi.listNamespacedPod(namespace, undefined, \
   undefined, undefined, undefined, Object.keys(podLabels).map \
   (key => `${key}=${podLabels[key]}`).join(','));

 
  for (const pod of pods.body.items) {
    const logsResponse = await coreApi.readNamespacedPodLog \
    (pod.metadata.name, namespace);
    const compressedLogs = gzipSync(logsResponse.body);
    const uploadParams = {
      Bucket: bucketName,
      Key: `${pod.metadata.name}-${compressedLogFilename}`,
      Body: compressedLogs,
    };
    const uploadCommand = new PutObjectCommand(uploadParams);
    await s3.send(uploadCommand);
    console.log(`Logs for pod ${pod.metadata.name} uploaded to S3 \
    bucket ${bucketName} as ${pod.metadata.name}-${compressedLogFilename}`);
  }
}
~~~

Finally, we invoke the `retrieveLogs()` function and handle any errors that may occur during its execution.

~~~{.js caption="index.js"}
retrieveLogs().catch((err) => console.error(err));
~~~

### Dockerizing the Script and Deploying to DockerHub

Now that we have our script, it's time to containerize it using Docker. We will create a Docker image that includes our NodeJS script and its dependencies, and then deploy it to our DockerHub repository.

Create a file `Dockerfile`  in your working directory and paste the following code snippets into it:

~~~{.dockerfile caption=""}
FROM node:18

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
~~~

Considering the `Dockerfile` above, each command specifies the following:

- `FROM node:18`: This line specifies the base image for the Docker container. Here, it is using the official [Node.js version 18](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) image as the base for the container.
- `WORKDIR /app`: This line sets the working directory inside the container to `/app` and defines that subsequent commands or instructions will be executed within this directory.
- `COPY package*.json ./`: This line copies the `package.json` file (and any other files starting with "package") from the host machine to the `/app` directory inside the container. It allows the dependencies defined in the `package.json` file to be installed within the container.
- `RUN npm install`: This line runs the `npm install` command inside the container to install the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.
- `COPY . .`: This line copies all the files and directories from the current directory (on the host machine) to the current working directory (/app) inside the container. It includes all the source code and additional files required for the application to function properly.
- `CMD [ "npm", "start" ]`: This line specifies the default command to be executed when the container starts. It runs the `npm start` command, which typically starts the Node.js application defined in the `package.json` file.

Build the image for our Node.js script with the command below:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
docker build -t <your-dockerhub-username/your-repo-name:tagname> .
~~~

<div class="notice--info">
Considering the command above, ensure you are logged in to your DockerHub account. Logging in is necessary to interact with your DockerHub account, such as pushing or pulling images. To log in, you can run the `docker login` command on your terminal or command prompt.

This command will prompt you to enter your DockerHub username and password. You will be logged in once you provide the correct credentials associated with your DockerHub account. Once logged in, you'll be able to perform various actions, such as pushing your local Docker images to your DockerHub repository or pulling images from DockerHub to your local machine; indicating that you have the necessary permissions and authentication to interact with DockerHub services.
</div>

<div class="wide">
![Building image for NodeJS script]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/VPeIr6U.png)
</div>

Now push this image to your DockerHub repository with the following command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
docker push <your-dockerhub-username/your-repo-name:tagname>
~~~

<div class="wide">
![Pushing image for NodeJS script to Dockerhub repository]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/LQoZfjO.png)
</div>

## Creating the CronJob

Since we now have our script on DockerHub, the next step is to create a CronJob in our cluster to use that script.

Create a file *`cronjob.yaml`* and paste into it the following configuration settings:

~~~{.yaml caption="cron-job.yaml"}
# cron-job.yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: mysql-logs
spec:
  schedule: "*/10 * * * *"
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 2
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 2
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: cronjob
            image: mercybassey/logs-cronjob:latest
            command: ["npm", "start"]
          restartPolicy: Never
~~~

This is what each section in the configuration settings above stand for:

- `apiVersion`: This specifies the API version of the CronJob resource.

- `kind`: This specifies the type of resource being defined, a CronJob.

- `metadata`: This section defines the metadata for the CronJob, including its name.

- `spec`: This section defines the desired behavior, schedule, and configuration of the CronJob resource and does the following:
  - Specifies the schedule for the CronJob. It uses a cron expression to define the frequency at which the job should run. Here, it will run every 10 minutes, using the `schedule` property.
  - Sets the `successfulJobsHistoryLimit` property to only keep two successful job completions in the job history.
  - Specifies the number of failed job completions to keep in the job history using the `failedJobsHistoryLimit` property.
  - Prevents concurrent runs of the CronJob resource by setting the value of the `concurrencyPolicy` property to `Forbid`.
  - Defines the template for creating individual job instances using the `jobTemplate` property, which contains the specifications for the template's pod, containers, and other resources.

## Deployment and Monitoring

To deploy the CronJob resource in our Kubernetes cluster, run the following commands.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl apply -f cronjob.yaml -n database
kubectl get cronjob -n database
~~~

The commands above will create and list the status of the CronJob, respectively.

You can see from the image below that the CronJob is scheduled to run every `10` minutes and is currently inactive:

<div class="wide">
![Creating and viewing cronjob]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/OIsSvoT.png)
</div>

You might want to execute the above command more than once to keep track of its active state. Once it is in an active state, execute the following commands sequentially to view the outcome of the CronJob:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
kubectl get job -n database
kubectl get pods -n database
kubectl log <THE_POD_NAME_CREATED_BY_THE_JOB> -n database
~~~

If you have the below output, then the CronJob was successful:

<div class="wide">
![Viewing successful cronjob]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Qqpy5AI.png)
</div>

You can see from the image above that the job retrieved the logs from Postgres, compressed them, then uploaded the logs of the two replicas `postgres-0` and `postgres-1` created by the `Postgrestatefulset` and uploaded them to your AWS S3 bucket.

You can also see from the image above that the naming convention for the compressed logs file follows the pattern of <POD_NAME-STATEFULSET_NAME-logs-TIMESTAMP.gz>. Here, the POD_NAME is `postgres-0`, representing a specific pod in the Statefulset. The STATEFULSET_NAME is `postgres`, denoting the name of the Statefulset to which the pod belongs. The inclusion of "logs" in the convention signifies that the file contains pod logs. The TIMESTAMP, such as `2023-05-11T06:00:07.035z`, represents the date and time of log file compression. The .gz extension indicates that the file is compressed using the [gzip algorithm](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/manual/gzip.html).

Once you head over to the S3 page on the AWS management console, you should see the log objects as shown below, which you can then download and use to suit your needs:

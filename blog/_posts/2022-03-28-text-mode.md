## Background

We have this new feature at [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/), where you can share your [local build log](https://ci.earthly.dev/logs?logId=10cd7603-ec37-4d1d-836d-017ba5c962b3) with others as a temporary webpage. This got me thinking about the reverse: turning a webpage into a text document.

Most of my time on the web, I'm just reading text. So why do I need complex HTML pages, CSS, and JavaScript to read the web? Why can't I just read things as text in my terminal?

Admittedly this is a bit of a strange question. Plain text doesn't have links, images, or video, but a lot of what I consume online would work as `.txt` file on an FTP server or old-school BBS, and I'd still get most of the value I'm getting today.

Text-Mode might be an improvement for the people with lousy dial-up connections who can't even load certain pages.

So I've made it. Send your url to [`https://earthly-tools.com/text-mode?url=yoururl`](https://earthly-tools.com/text-mode?url=) to get a plain text version of the page.

Here are some examples:

## Examples

### Substack

## How It Works

The URL is served by an AWS Lambda that uses [Mozilla Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) library combined with the [Lynx browser](https://lynx.invisible-island.net/) to turn html into text. This is a POC. Nothing is cached, and it's not super fast, but it saves page bandwidth. Using it, you choose a different set of trade-offs than the modern web typically offers: fewer features but fewer round-trips and less bandwidth.

Let me know what you think.

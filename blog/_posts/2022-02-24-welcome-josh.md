The team at Earthly is growing quickly and Josh Alletto is our latest hire. He'll be coming onboard as Senior Technical Content Engineer. I sat down with him to ask some questions about his background and what brought him to Earthly.

### What is your origin story? When did you first get interested in software development / dev ops?

I did not start out with a technical background. I was a literature major in college. I started teaching writing courses in grad school and continued to teach highschool and college level writing for about ten years. In my spare time I started to do some coding as a hobby. I didn't really have an end goal in mind, I wasn't trying to build a business or automate something, I was just really curious about how things worked. Eventually I started to wonder if I could actually make some money with these new skills. Turns out the answer is yes, and compared to teaching, the answer is hell yes. I ended up going to a coding bootcamp that no longer exists. I've been working in tech ever since.

I still love sharing knowledge, so even though I've changed careers, I try to keep some kind of teaching in my life. I've taught at coding bootcamps, created technical curriculmn and I regularly write about new things I've learned.


### What made you interested in Earthly?
A friend told me about Earthly and how they were looking to hire a technical content engineer. I was working in devops at the time, but I had been doing a lot of technical writing on the side. Because I came from a job where we had been working heavily with CI/CD tools, creating build pipelines I immediately understood the power of a tool like Earthly.

### What unique perspectives does your background give you on software development?

My teaching background really helps me as a developer. I need to learn new things quickly and often need to explain complex topics succinctly. Both skills I learned teaching. A teaching background has also made me really good at giving presentations and leading trainings, even though at heart I am an introvert who hates being the center of attention. But basically, if I'm really excited about something, I can't I can't shut up about it.


I also think the fact that I don't come from a technical background helps me bring a different perspective. There are a lot of times it has been a weakness for me, but I've learned to see it as a positive. When you're trying to teach someone something either in person or in a tutorial, it's important to remember what it was like to be the learner. In a lot of ways I'm still really close to that learners mindset and I understand what it feels like to be overwhelmed by

### What interests you about a technical communication role?
I love writing, teaching, and learning. A technical writing role gives me the chance to alternate between those roles.

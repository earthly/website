We're excited to announce that Earthly is participating in Hacktoberfest this October [again](/blog/hacktoberfest-2020).

Last year we saw lots of great contributions from the community and sent out a bunch of Earthly stickers to participants.

## What Is It?

The hosting provider DigitalOcean is once again organizing the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) to celebrate open source. Hacktoberfest invites you to submit pull requests to open-source projects. People who submit four or more pull requests, get a free t-shirt from DigitalOcean.

## Sticker Rewards

In addition to this official event, Earthly would also like to kick in some rewards for people who contribute.

Earthly is a free and open build tool. &nbsp;It lets you build everything using containers.

The first 40 participants who submit at least one pull request that is accepted [Earthly's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/earthly/earthly) between October 1, 2021 and November 1, 2021, will get an earthly sticker. &nbsp;We have labeled many issues [`hacktoberfest`](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest) to get you started.

You can also qualify for the sticker by adding a working Earthfile file to another open-source project, including your own personal project.

## How Do I Claim my Sticker?

Once your PR has been accepted please fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/DVkrWCu4yD2wMPmE8). All PRs that are contributing value will get an Earthly sticker!

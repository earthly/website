Once your draft is approved, we'll let you know when it will be coming out on the blog.

#### The Edit Process

An article will go through up to two rounds of editing, via google docs. We suggest reading your article out-loud, and run it through grammarly.com before submitting it, to weed out any simple mistakes.

( Make sure your document markdown in a google doc and world editable. )

First time authors should expect to spend some time responding to edits and updating the article.

Articles that don't reach our publishing standards will not be published.

Writers are paid upon article publication.

</div>

### 4. Get Paid

We will pay you $350 USD for your article and use our Twitter account to promote your article to our audience of developers.

<div class="notice--info">

After your article has been accepted please send us an invoice. Invoice should include the following: Date, Title of Article, Amount, Bank name, Back account number/IBAN, Routing Number/SWIFT code/ABA.

If you need help with invoicing or have other questions about payment, please feel free to reach out.

There is an excellent open-source project that you have probably used without realizing it. It's called BuildKit, and it is what turns a Dockerfile into a Docker image. And it doesn't just build Docker images; it can build OCI images and several other output formats. [OpenFasS](https://www.openfaas.com/) uses it to turn functions into full containers, and here at Earthly, we use it to create complete continuous integration pipelines.  

You may not know you've used BuildKit because other applications wrap it. Modern versions of `docker build` can use BuildKit and it will soon be enabled by default. Today let's look at how to use BuildKit directly.

## History

> BuildKit is a new project under the Moby umbrella for building and packaging software using containers. It's a new codebase meant to replace the internals of the current build features in the Moby Engine. - [Introducing BuildKit](https://blog.mobyproject.org/introducing-buildkit-17e056cc5317)

Tõnis Tiigi,  a Docker employee and BuildKit's primary developer, created BuildKit to separate the logic of building images from the main moby project and to enable future development. BuildKit has support for pluggable frontends, which allow it to make more than just docker images using dockerfiles. With BuildKit, we can substitute the dockerfile syntax for [hlb](https://github.com/openllb/hlb) and replace the docker image format for a pure tar file output. That is just one of the possible combinations BuildKit, with its pluggable backends and frontends, unlocks.

The original BuildKit proposal is found in the moby project:
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD028 -->

> "Buildkit is a proposal to separate out docker build experience into a separate project, allowing different users to collaborate on the underlying technology and reuse and customize it in different ways."

> "One of the main design goals of BuildKit is to separate frontend and backend concerns during a build process" - [Intial BuildKit Proposal](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/32925)

## Install BuildKit

### buildctl

BuildKit has two primary components: buildctl and buildkitd. buildctl is the BuildKit controller, and it communicates with `buildkitd`. Though designed for Linux, it can run on macOS and Windows under WSL2.  

On macOS, you can install buildctl with brew.  

```
brew install buildkit
```

On Linux and Windows, grab a release from [Github](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases).

Afterward, you should be able to call buildctl

```
➜  ~ buildctl
NAME:
   buildctl - build utility

USAGE:
   buildctl [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   0.8.1

COMMANDS:
   du        disk usage
   prune     clean up build cache
   build, b  build
   debug     debug utilities
   help, h   Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --debug                enable debug output in logs
   --addr value           buildkitd address (default: "unix:///run/buildkit/buildkitd.sock")
   --tlsservername value  buildkitd server name for certificate validation
   --tlscacert value      CA certificate for validation
   --tlscert value        client certificate
   --tlskey value         client key
   --tlsdir value         directory containing CA certificate, client certificate, and client key
   --timeout value        timeout backend connection after value seconds (default: 5)
   --help, -h             show help
   --version, -v          print the version
```

 ***Other Tools**: In this guide, we will use [pstree](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pstree), [br](https://github.com/Canop/broot), and [mitmproxy](/blog/mitmproxy/). They are not required to use BuildKit or to follow this guide, but they help us demonstrate how BuildKit works.*

### buildkitd

buildkitd does the actual work of transforming a build definition into some output. It is designed to be a long-running process. It also isn't possible to run it on macOS or Windows. For this tutorial, we will run it as a docker container. That will work regardless of your host OS.

```
➜ docker run --rm --privileged -d --name buildkit moby/buildkit

6c4342639e07   moby/buildkit "buildkitd" 45 seconds ago   Up 43 seconds             buildkit
```

We also need to tell buildctl where to find buildkitd:

```
export BUILDKIT_HOST=docker-container://buildkit
```

*On Linux, you can substitute these steps with just running `buildkitd` to avoid the container.*

## Building an Image

Now that we have all dependencies we need, let's build an image using BuildKit:

```
cat .\DockerFile
FROM alpine
RUN echo "built with BuildKit!" >  file
CMD ["/bin/sh"]
```

```
➜buildctl build \
    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \
    --local context=. \
    --local dockerfile=.
[+] Building 1.4s (5/5) FINISHED

 => => transferring dockerfile: 453B                      0.0s
 => [internal] load .dockerignore                         0.0s
 => => transferring context: 2B                           0.0s

 => [1/2] FROM docker.io/library/alpine@sha256:08d6ca16c  0.0s
 => => resolve docker.io/library/alpine@sha256:08d6ca16c  0.0s
  => [2/2] RUN echo "built with buildkit!" >  file   
```

We have built the image, but we haven't given it a name nor told BuildKit what to do with it.

By default, the build result will remain internal to BuildKit. An output type needs to be specified to retrieve the result. Let's specify a docker hub account that we have permission to push to:

```
➜ buildctl build \
    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \
    --local context=. \
    --local dockerfile=. \
    --output type=image,name=docker.io/agbell/test,push=true
[+] Building 2.9s (8/8) FINISHED

 => [internal] load .dockerignore                         0.0s

 => [2/2] RUN echo "built with buildkit!" >  file

 => => exporting config sha256:4c8c89bca725572cf9ff3bd6a  0.0s
```

After that, we can pull it and run it:

```
➜ docker run -it agbell/test
/ # cat file
built with BuildKit!
```

## Tangent: Where are `FROM's from

If we have an image locally on our machine, can we use it in a `FROM` to build something based on it? Let's find out by altering our `FROM` to use a local image:

```
FROM agbell/test:local
RUN echo "BuildKit built">  file
CMD ["/bin/sh"] 

```

```
> docker tag alpine agbell/test:local
> buildctl build \
    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \
    --local context=. \
    --local dockerfile=. \
------
 > [internal] load metadata for docker.io/agbell/test:local:
------
error: failed to solve: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to solve with frontend dockerfile.v0: failed to create LLB definition: docker.io/agbell/test:local: not found

```

It doesn't work. It looks like it is trying to fetch the image from docker.io, the default docker hub registry.  

We can verify this by quickly [capturing requests](https://earthly.dev/blog/mitmproxy/) from buildkitd:

```
➜ cat ~\Dockerfile
FROM moby/buildkit 
RUN apk update && apk add curl
WORKDIR /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
COPY mitmproxy.crt mitmproxy.crt
RUN update-ca-certificates
➜ docker build . -t buildkit:mitm
 ...
➜ docker run --rm --privileged -d --name buildkit buildkit:mitm
6676dc0109eb3f5f09f7380d697005b6aae401bb72a4ee366f0bb279c0be137b
```

![404 on mitm proxy](/blog/assets/images/what-is-buildkit-and-what-can-i-do-with-it/2.png)

We can see a `404`, and this confirms buildkitd is expecting registry that it can access over the network using the docker registry v2 api.

## Watching It Build

Buildkitd is responsible for building the image, but `runc` does the actual execution of each step. runc executes each `RUN` command in your dockerfile in a separate process. runc requires Linux kernel 5.2  or later with support for cgroups, and is why buildkitd can't run natively on macOS or Windows.

### What is runc

> "Please note that runc is a low-level tool not designed with an end-user in mind. It is mostly employed by other higher-level container software. Therefore, unless there is some specific use case that prevents the use of tools like Docker or Podman, it is not recommended to use runc directly." - [runc readme](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)

We can watch the execution of our build by using `pstree` and `watch`. Open two side by side terminals, run `docker exec -it buildkit "/bin/watch" "-n1" "pstree -p"` in one and call `buildctl build ...` in the other. You will see `buildkitd` start a `buildkit-runc` process and then a separate process for each `RUN` command.

![Diagram of buildkit running and pstree showing the process tree of buildkitd](/blog/assets/images/what-is-buildkit-and-what-can-i-do-with-it/3.png)

## How to see Docker Processes on macOS and Windows

On macOS and Windows, Docker processes run on a separate virtual machine (VM). If you're using the default and recommended Docker Desktop, this VM is the Linux container host.  

*Note: Docker Machine is an earlier approach to running Docker on macOS and Windows where the Docker VM runs in VirtualBox or VMware. Docker Machine steps may differ.*

The above `exec` trick lets us see the processes inside a specific container, but to see all the processes running across all the containers, we need a different technique. To do that, we can use `docker run` and `nsenter`:

```
docker run -it --rm --privileged --pid=host ubuntu nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i s
```

We can now use `watch` and `pstree` to view the whole container host in a single view:

```
docker-desktop:/# pstree -p
init(1)-+-containerd(983)
        |-containerd-shim(1018)---acpid(1039)
        |-containerd-shim(1064)---diagnosticsd(1085)---sh(1354)
        |-containerd-shim(1109)-+-containerd-shim(2495)-+-buildkitd(2522)
        |                       |                       `-sh(2614)---watch(2903)
        |                       |-containerd-shim(4035)---sh(4062)---pstree(5058)
        |                       |-docker-init(1136)---entrypoint.sh(1154)---logwrite(1183)---lifecycle-serve(1188)-+-logwrite(1340)---containerd(1345)
        |                       |                                                                                  |-logwrite(1550)---dockerd(1555)
        |                       |                                                                                  `-logwrite(1800)
        |                       |-rpc.statd(1293)
        |                       `-rpcbind(1265)
        |-containerd-shim(1162)---host-timesync-d(1199)
        |-containerd-shim(1245)---kmsg(1282)
        |-containerd-shim(1310)---start(1347)---sntpc(1397)
        |-containerd-shim(1374)
        |-containerd-shim(1433)---trim-after-dele(1460)
        |-containerd-shim(1483)---vpnkit-forwarde(1517)
        |-memlogd(442)
        |-rungetty.sh(429)---login(431)---sh(443)
        |-rungetty.sh(432)---login(433)---sh(437)
        `-vpnkit-bridge(452)
```

We can use pstree with a process id (pid) while a build is running to focus on just the buildkitd tree:

```
docker-desktop:/# watch -n 1 pstree -p 2522 
```

## BuildKit Output Types

So far, we have only used `output type=image,` but BuildKit supports several types of outputs.

We can output a tar:

```
buildctl build \
    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \
    --local context=. \
    --local dockerfile=. \
    --output type=tar,dest=out.tar
 => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile      0.0s
 => => transferring dockerfile: 31B                       0.0s
 => [internal] load .dockerignore                         0.0s
 => => transferring context: 2B                           0.0s
...
 => exporting to client                                   2.6s
 => => sending tarball                                    2.6s
```

```
> ls *.tar
 out.tar
```

And if we try to load it as a docker image, it will fail:

```
> docker load < out.tar
open /var/lib/docker/tmp/docker-import-013443725/bin/json: no such file or directory
```

This tag isn't an image of any sort. There are no layers or manifests, just the full filesystem that the built image would contain.

We can also export directly to the local filesystem:

```
buildctl build --frontend dockerfile.v0 --local context=. --local dockerfile=. --output type=local,dest=output   
[+] Building 2.6s (10/10) FINISHED

 => [internal] load .dockerignore                         0.0s

 => CACHED [2/5] RUN apk update                           0.0s
 => CACHED [3/5] RUN apk upgrade                          0.0s
 => CACHED [4/5] RUN apk add gcc                          0.0s
 => CACHED [5/5] RUN sleep 1                              0.0s
 => exporting to client                                   1.9s
 => => copying files 121.14MB                             1.9sr
```

This filesystem output could be useful if we were trying to trim our image down. We could look through the output and find things to remove and use a multi-stage build to remove them. [broot](https://github.com/Canop/broot) is pretty handy for this:

![tree view of alpine image showing space used in each directory]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/4.png)

## What is in `FROM scratch`

One thing we can do with our newfound powers is investigate the `scratch` keyword. The scratch keyword doesn't correspond to an actual image. We can't run it:

```
docker run scratch
Unable to find image' scratch:latest' locally
docker: Error response from daemon: 'scratch' is a reserved name.
```

However, does it actually contain anything? Is a `FROM scratch` image literally empty or are there certain required elements of unix filesystem that `scratch` provides? Let's find out:

```
> mkdir scratch
> cat .\Dockerfile
FROM scratch
> buildctl build --frontend dockerfile.v0 --local context=. --local dockerfile=. --output type=local,dest=scratch
[+] Building 0.1s (3/3) FINISHED                               
 => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile      0.0s
 => => transferring dockerfile: 31B                       0.0s
 => [internal] load .dockerignore                         0.0s
 => => transferring context: 2B                           0.0s
 => exporting to client                                   0.0s
 => => copying files                                      0.0s
 > ls scratch
 > br -s scratch
 0 ./output
```

It's empty! The scratch keyword indicates a completely empty docker layer. The more you know! *(The more you know is a trademark of The National Broadcasting Company, who in no way endorse this article 😀 )*

## Conclusion

Alright, we have now covered some ways to use BuildKit directly. BuildKit is used internally by `docker build` in modern docker versions, but using it directly unlocks some extra options.

One use we covered was changing the output type. We can use BuildKit to export tars and local file systems. We also use `pstree` and `mitmProxy` to watch how buildkitd forks processes and make network requests.  

There is much more to learn, though. BuildKit is behind the `docker buildx` multiplatform build feature and supports the ability to have multiple workers execute builds in parallel. BuildKit also supports caching, different frontends, docker-compose builds, faster multi-stage builds, and several other features.

In a future article, we will cover creating a custom frontend and leaving the Dockerfile syntax behind.

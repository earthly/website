Since their introduction in Python 3.7, data classes have emerged as a popular choice for classes that store data. In a [previous tutorial](/blog/python-data-classes), we talked about what data classes are and some of their features, including out-of-the-box support for object comparison, type hints, and default values of fields.

In this follow-up tutorial, we'll continue to explore a few more features of Python data classes.

## Useful Features of Python Data Classes

### Set More Complex Default Values With `default_factory`

### Exclude Fields from the Constructor

### Use `__post_init__` to Create Fields Post Initialization

### Order and Sort Data Class Instances

### Subclass Data Classes to Extend Functionality

### Use Slots for Improved Performance

## Conclusion

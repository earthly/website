<figcaption>Every explanation is a simplification.</figcaption>
</div>

There are many ways to understand how containers work, but most useful explanations are actually simplifications.

Many people have settled on explaining containers by calling them 'light-weight VMs' and they are light-weight because they 'share the kernel with the host'. This is useful, but it simplifies a lot away. What is a 'light-weight VM'? What does sharing the kernel mean?

Others will tell you containers are about namespaces and specific kernel visibility tweaks. This is also a helpful explanation because namespaces partition visibility, so that running containers can't see other things on the same machine.

But for me, containers are just chrooted processes. Sure, they are more than that: Containers have a nice developer experience, an open-source foundation, and a whole ecosystem of cloud-native companies pushing them forward. But, let me show you why I think `chroot`[^7] is the key.

**So, let's build a container runtime using only the chroot system call.** Doing so, we can learn a little about `chroot`, a little about container runtimes, and it will also be fun!

## The Goal

By the end, I'll have something that looks like docker run, called `chrun`, where you can pull docker images:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> chrun pull redis

Pulling image redis
export image 16b87aa63c8f3a1e14a50feb94cba39eaa5d19bec64d90ff76c3ded058ad09c8
~~~

And then run them:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> chrun run redis "/usr/local/bin/redis-server"
~~~

~~~{.merge-code}

And it will do this using chroot. But first, some background.

## History of `chroot`

<div class="wide">
{% picture content-wide-nocrop {{site.pimages}}{{page.slug}}/5730.png --alt {{ To the ~~Observatory~~ Unix Source }} %}
<figcaption>To the ~~Observatory~~ Unix Source</figcaption>
</div>

`chroot` probably doesn't get a lot of mention now that containers exist, but it's a Unix system call. This means it's a way to request something from the operating system kernel. It is also a utility program, so it's easy to call from the shell.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> chroot /bin /bash
~~~

All it does is change the root directory (`/`) to a new value. That's all chrooting does. It just changes what `/` means. That sounds simple, but file paths are at the heart of how Unix works, so you can do a lot with this call.

Chroot is a much older system call than the ones modern container runtimes use, which means, in theory, the `chrun` shown above could run on a much older linux kernel. But how far back into Linux history could we go?

Actually, we can go back to way before the creation of Linux. chroot first appeared in 1979 for Unix v7.

(I know this because Diomidis Spinellis put together this excellent [github repository](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo) that recreates the history of Unix from the earliest available source to today's modern variations[^1]. The history recreated in this repo stretches back to 1970 and includes the original [PDP-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-7#/media/File:Pdp7-oslo-2005.jpeg) assembly code of the first iteration of Unix.)

It came along with chdir ( the system call equivalent of `cd` ) and looked like this:

~~~{.c caption="usr/sys/sys/sys4.c (UNIX V7)"}
chdir()
{
    chdirec(&u.u_cdir);
}

chroot()
{
    if (suser())
        chdirec(&u.u_rdir);
}
~~~

<figcaption> chroot and chdir - Source: [Research-V7 tag of Unix History Repo](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/b69600335168d140ef119fcc1eba3265faed094e/usr/sys/sys/sys4.c#L199)</figcaption>

~~~{.c caption="usr/sys/h/user.h (UNIX V7)"}
struct user
{
    ...
    struct inode *u_cdir;        /* pointer to inode of current directory */
    struct inode *u_rdir;        /* root directory of current process */
    ...
}
~~~

<figcaption> `&u` is a reference to the [current users struct](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/b69600335168d140ef119fcc1eba3265faed094e/usr/sys/h/user.h#L46), which holds `u_rdir` and `u_cdir`.</figcaption>

So, a user on a Unix system has a current directory and root directory and chroot is a way to change the root value (`u_rdir`) in the same way `cd` changes the current working directory (`u_cdir`). In Unix V7 that's basically all the `chroot` code I see, except for the syscall list and some userland code so that you can call `chroot` from your shell:

~~~{.c caption="usr/src/libc/sys/chroot.s (UNIX V7)"}
/ C library -- chroot

/ error = chroot(string);

.globl    _chroot
.globl    cerror
.chroot = 61.

_chroot:
    mov    r5,-(sp)
    mov    sp,r5
    mov    4(r5),0f
    sys    0; 9f
    bec    1f
    jmp    cerror
1:
    clr    r0
    mov    (sp)+,r5
    rts    pc
.data
9:
    sys    .chroot; 0:..
~~~

So chroot goes way back, back into the 70s, and while the implementation has probably changed over the years, semantically it still matches the description found in the UNIX V7 Manual:

> Chroot sets the root directory, the starting point for path names beginning with `/`. The call is restricted to the super-user.

Ok, history lesson over. Let's start building things.

## Using `chroot` Directly

Let's start with the command-line and work towards our docker run clone.

The most straightforward docker run is hello-world:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> docker run hello-world
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.
...
~~~

To recreate run this hello-world in `chroot jail`[^2] is relatively straightforward.

## `chroot` Hello World

At the command line, I can setup the hello-world in a changed root like so:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> mkdir /testroot
> cp hello /testroot
~~~

Then run it:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> chroot  /testroot /hello

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

<div class="notice">

## The Root of the Matter

`chroot` only works as a root user, so assume from here on out everything is being done as root on a Linux machine.

If you try as a non-root user, you will get something like this:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}

> chroot /testroot /hello
chroot: cannot change root directory to '/testroot': Operation not permitted

~~~

</div>

We can also do this from go, making the system call directly:

~~~{.bash caption="chrun.go"}
package main

import (
    "os"
    "os/exec"
    "syscall"
)

func main() {
    cmd := exec.Command("/hello")
    syscall.Chroot("/testroot")
    cmd.Stdin = os.Stdin
    cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout
    cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr
    cmd.Run()
}
~~~

And the output is the same:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> go run go-change-root.go 

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
~~~

That hello process runs with a filesystem rooted to `/testroot`. So there is nothing in the filesystem it can see besides itself.  

I could verify that by running a shell inside it and poking around. However, when you change the root, the command passed is relative to the new root, so running `/bin/sh` will fail.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> chroot /testroot /bin/sh
chroot: /bin/sh: No such file or directory
~~~

I could `cp` `/bin/sh` into  `/testroot`, but `sh` dynamically links in libc and probably other stuff. Those file pointers won't point to anything in our new root so it won't work. This is also why you can't shell into the hello-world image with `docker run`:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> docker run -it hello-world /bin/sh
exec: "/bin/sh": stat /bin/sh: no such file or directory: unknown.
~~~

Predictably, you can only shell into an image with a shell (and supporting userspace dependencies) inside it. So I'm going to be using `redis:latest` today:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> docker run -it redis /bin/sh
> cd /
> ls
bin  boot  data  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run
sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
~~~

Now let's try to chroot into this redis image. But to do that, I first need to get the file-system out of the image so I can pass it to `chroot`.

## Extracting FileSystems From Container

To extract file-system from the image, the first thing I'll try is to grab the image and extract it:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
docker save redis -o redisImage.tar
mkdir redis
cd redis && tar -mxvf ../redisImage.tar 
~~~

I can then look inside it:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
redis

I'm on the right track, but this is not exactly what I wanted. Each `layer.tar` is the union file-system changes for that image layer. To build the completed file structure I would need to extract each of these and combine them in the right order.

Thankfully, I can just ask docker to do that for us with `docker export`.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> docker export $(docker create redis) -o redis.tar.gz
> mkdir redis && cd redis
> tar --no-same-owner --no-same-permissions --owner=0 --group=0 \
  -mxf ../redis.tar.gz
~~~

Then I end up with the extracted redis file structure:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
./redis
├── bin
├── boot
├── data
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
├── lib
├── lib64
├── media
├── mnt
├── opt
├── proc
├── root
├── run
├── sbin
├── sys
├── tmp
├── usr
└── var
~~~

And so if I wrap that `docker export` up into a bash script, I can grab the file system for any image on docker hub, turning any Linux container image into a tar file.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
./pull "redis"                
Pulling image redis
export image c20f5ecac2f9c49521b32433ffc6abeade950e77592805b0fc61fea00d6e32f5
~~~

<figcaption>Pull the file-system from an image. ( [source](https://github.com/adamgordonbell/chroot-containers/blob/main/pull))</figcaption>

From there, my trusty rusty `chroot` command works much like my `docker run -it redis /bin/sh` from a couple of steps ago:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> chroot ./redis /bin/sh
> ls
bin  boot  data  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run 
 sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
~~~

### It's Just a Process

<div class="align-right">
 {% picture {{site.pimages}}{{page.slug}}/6560.png --picture --img width="260px" --alt {{ The container was a process all along }} %}
</div>
Here is why this is interesting from a learning perspective:

When I run `docker run ..` something happens – an image is turned into a container and started up. It's not really a VM, but if you shell inside and look around, it seems like one. But now, with chroot at hand, you can see what 'not really a VM means: It's just a process!

Namespaces mean when you start a container, you can't see it in your process list, and cgroups mean that the process can have CPU and memory limits placed on it, but really, at a conceptual level, it's just a process running with a different file-system root. Really containers are just a fancier way to chroot something!

Ok, let's keep going.

## ChRun Time

Another thing you may have noticed about containers is that they are ephemeral and relatively isolated. I can run N containers from one image and they will each be unique. Modern container runtimes use a union file-system ( like overlayfs ) for this but I get close to that with just temp directories.

Here's my plan. When `chrun pull <imagename>` is called, I grab a tar of the image and store it somewhere. Then each time `chrun run <imagename>` is called, I'll do the following:

* Create a temporary directory
* Extract `<imagename>.tar.gz` into it
* Change root into that directory
* On exit, delete the directory

It's looks like this:

~~~{.go caption="chrun.go"}
func main() {
    tar := fmt.Sprintf("./assets/%s.tar.gz", os.Args[2])
    cmd := os.Args[3]
    dir := createTempDir(tar)
    defer os.RemoveAll(dir)
    must(unTar(tar, dir))
    chroot(dir, cmd)
}
~~~

First, I create a temp directory:

~~~{.go caption="chrun.go"}
func createTempDir(name string) string {
    var nonAlphanumericRegex = regexp.MustCompile(`[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]+`)
    prefix := nonAlphanumericRegex.ReplaceAllString(name, "_")
    dir, err := ioutil.TempDir("", prefix)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    return dir
}
~~~

Then I untar things:

~~~{.go caption="chrun.go"}
func unTar(source string, dst string) error {
    r, err := os.Open(source)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer r.Close()

    ctx := context.Background()
    return extract.Archive(ctx, r, dst, nil)
}
~~~

And then `chroot`, and we're off:

~~~{.go caption="chrun.go"}
func chroot(root string, call string) {
    fmt.Printf("Running %s in %s\n", call, root)
    cmd := exec.Command(call)
    must(syscall.Chroot(root))
    cmd.Stdin = os.Stdin
    cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout
    cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr
    must(cmd.Run())
}
~~~

( There are actually a couple more bits to it, but they are uninteresting. Entire file in [this repo](https://github.com/adamgordonbell/chroot-containers). )

And with that, I can do things like start up a redis client and server and have them talk to each other:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
> ./chrun pull redis
Pulling image redis
export image 16b87aa63c8f3a1e14a50feb94cba39eaa5d19bec64d90ff76c3ded058ad09c8

<figcaption>Because of the temp dirs, you can start many processes from one image, and each gets its own file-system. They can talk to each other over the network.</figcaption>

And after I stop them, the temp dir is removed, and they disappear. **So there you go, 'containers' using only chroot.**

## Who Cares?
<!--sgpt-->
While there are many efficient container runtimes available, understanding the concept of containers as chrooted processes can demystify them. Containers, including features like namespaces, cgroups v2, runC, and overlayfs, represent substantial advancements, but they're not magic, they're technical improvements built over Unix's long-standing features. 

The name `chroot` (change root) describes a program running in a limited root, without access to files outside this root. Though it's often dubbed a 'chroot jail', breaking out is sometimes possible. Containers provide additional restrictions than chroot, but shouldn't be seen solely as security barriers but more as abstraction barriers.

Considering chroot's roots (no pun intended) helps understanding complaints about Docker taking up too much space - more about disk-crowding images than containers themselves. It even opens exciting possibilities as building native OS X containers based on chroot offering almost no overhead and faster volume mounts, for example.

As you continue to explore the world of containers, you might want to simplify your build processes. This is where [Earthly](https://www.earthly.dev/) comes in. It's a tool designed to make your build processes more efficient and less complicated. So, dive deeper and check it out!

## Image without figure

![some alt text]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/alex-drag.png)

## Image with figure

{% include imgf src="alex-draw.png" alt="handddrawn cartoon for a person talking to a computer server" caption="Alex likes to draw and add a caption" %}

### graph (not working)
```{
  .matplotlib
  format=SVG
  source=false
  }
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure()
plt.plot([0,1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4,5])
plt.title('This is an example figure')
```

### Code blocks (with syntax highlighting)

``` go
    syntax = "proto3";
    package simplekeyvalue;
    option go_package = "kvapi";
    
    // The key/value API contains two procedures for storing and retrieving data
    service KeyValue {
      rpc Set (SetRequest) returns (SetReply) {}
      rpc Get (GetRequest) returns (GetReply) {}
    }
```

**This article explains the basics of setting up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with Terraform. Users of Terraform find Earthly's approach to CI build speed powerful. [Learn how](https://cloud.earthly.dev/login).**

[Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) is a service that allows you to create a virtual network within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud environment. It gives you complete control over your network configuration, including your choice of IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. With Amazon VPCs, you can securely launch AWS resources, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and Lambda functions, in a logically isolated environment.

VPCs offer several benefits, including the following:

- **Increased security:** VPCs give you control over who has access to your resources and how they can communicate with each other.
- **Increased flexibility:** VPCs give you the flexibility to design your network architecture to meet your specific needs.
- **Improved performance:** VPCs can help improve the performance of your applications by reducing network latency.

Meanwhile, [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open source infrastructure-as-code (IaC) software tool developed by HashiCorp that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. Terraform can be used to manage infrastructure on a variety of platforms, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), using a declarative configuration language (*ie* HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)).

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a VPC on AWS using Terraform. In doing so, you'll learn about all the elements of a VPC and how to configure each of them.

## How to Create a VPC on AWS Using Terraform

Before you begin, you need an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/), and you need to [install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) version 2.11.20 (or newer).

To check what version of the AWS CLI you have, run the following:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
aws --version
~~~

Output:

~~~{ caption="Output"}
aws-cli/2.11.20 Python/3.11.3 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off
~~~

You also need to install Terraform version 1.4.6 or newer. A list of the available Terraform executables for each platform is available on [Terraform's website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads):

<div class="wide">
![Download Terraform]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/JggjP8o.png)
</div>

Once you've installed Terraform, run the following command to get the Terraform version and confirm that it is installed correctly:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
terraform --version
~~~

My version is 1.4.6, running on the Windows platform:

~~~{ caption="Output"}
Terraform v1.4.6 on windows_amd64
~~~

Finally, create a new directory called `terraform-vpc-demo`. This will be your project file. The full Terraform configuration used in this guide can be found on this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Ndafara/Terraform-Create-AWS-VPCs).

### Configure AWS Credentials

Once you've created your new directory, it's time to configure Terraform to work with your AWS account.

### Create a Terraform User

To configure Terraform and AWS to work together, you need to log into your AWS Management Console with a user account that can create other users (*ie* a root AWS account or an account with administrator access):

<div class="wide">
![AWS Management Console]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/6dCzqJY.png)
</div>

You need the IAM user as that is what Terraform will use to read and update your AWS environment. This IAM user will perform the actions specified by your Terraform commands.

Once logged in, select **IAM**:

<div class="wide">
![Select IAM]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/cC1KwJu.png)
</div>

Click on **Users** to open the users' console;

<div class="wide">
![IAM]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Wx55xlR.png)
</div>

And then select **Add users** in the upper right-hand corner:

<div class="wide">
![**Add users**]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/PKCJZxe.png)
</div>

This opens up the **Create user** page where you can specify the user details. Give the user a name (*ie* terraform-user) and make sure you leave the "Provide user access to the AWS Management Console" unchecked, as you don't need access to this:

<div class="wide">
![Specify user details]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/REQA5hl.png)
</div>

Click on **Next** to set the permissions. Then under **Permissions options**, select **Attach policies directly**, and under **Permissions policies**, tick the checkbox next to **AdministratorAccess**. This gives the user the permissions they need to create any resource with Terraform:

<div class="wide">
![Set permissions]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/qn35bWz.png)
</div>

Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on **Next** to review and create the user.

Make sure everything is as you intend; then select **Create user**.

<div class="wide">
![Review and create]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Oxbg3Sd.png)
</div>

You should receive a confirmation that the user has been successfully created and the user has been added to the list of users:

<div class="wide">
![User successfully created]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/bLreYGY.png)
</div>

To view the new user's details, you can click on **View user** on the confirmation at the top of your screen, or you can select the new username in your list of users.

On the **terraform-user** details page, select **Security credentials**:

<div class="wide">
![Select **Security credentials**]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/obXKNMO.png)
</div>

Then scroll down to the **Access keys** section and select **Create access key**:

<div class="wide">
![**Access keys** section]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/P7jkWIe.png)
</div>

Select the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** option and tick the **I understand the above recommendation and want to proceed to create an access key** checkbox:

<div class="wide">
![Access key best practice]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/W0Nb0Y8.png)
</div>

Select **Next** to set the optional description tag and add the following description: "Access key for terraform demo":

<div class="wide">
![Set description tag]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/576R0wz.png)
</div>

Then click on **Create access key**. You'll get confirmation that the key was created successfully. Click on **Show** to view the key, or you can download a CSV file with the credentials. Make sure you save this information in a safe place as this is the only time you can access the secret key:

<div class="wide">
![Retrieve access keys]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/TGJ0MHP.png)
</div>

Click on **Done** to close the **Retrieve access keys** page.

### Configure the AWS Credentials

After creating your new Terraform user, you need to set the credentials (*ie* access key and secret access key) to be used by Terraform to provision resources. To do so, open a new terminal, and run the `aws configure` command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
aws configure
~~~

Follow the prompts to set the following fields: **AWS Access Key ID**, **AWS Secret Access Key**, **Default region name**, and **Default output format**.

Input the access key ID and secret access key you retrieved previously. For the region name, put in the default region you want to use (*ie* `eu-west-1`). The **Default output format** can be any of JSON, YAML, YAML-stream, text, and table. However, If you don't put anything in there, it defaults to JSON (which is what's used in this tutorial):

<div class="wide">
![Configure your AWS credentials]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/K7VSsAj.png)
</div>

### Build the VPC

Now that Terraform is installed and your AWS credentials are configured, it's time to build the VPC.

Create a VPC with the following components:

| Component | Description |
|:----- |:----- |
| Subnets | Subnets are subdivisions of a VPC's IP address range. A subnet is a smaller, more specific part of a VPC that's used to segregate resources such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) or Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)  within the VPC. Subnets are identified by a [Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cidr/) and can be public or private. Public subnets have a route to the internet gateway, but private subnets do not. |
| Internet gateway | An [internet gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) enables the communication between EC2 instances in a VPC and the internet. It provides a target for routing traffic to and from the internet. |
| NAT gateway | A Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway is a network interface that allows instances in a private subnet to access the public internet. It essentially acts as a bridge between the private subnets and the internet. |
| Security groups | Security groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for instances within a VPC. They define the allowed protocols, ports, and IP ranges for communication. |

Navigate to the project directory that you created previously (*ie* `terraform-vpc-demo`) and create `main.tf` and `resources.tf` files in it. The `main.tf` file contains all the VPC configurations, and the `resources.tf` file contains all the configurations of the resources you create in the VPC.

Add the following code to the `main.tf` file:

~~~{.tf caption="main.tf"}
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"  # Replace with your desired AWS region
}

resource "aws_vpc" "demo-vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = {
    Name = "demo-vpc"
  }
}
~~~

This code sets the provider as AWS. A provider is a plugin that lets Terraform manage an external API, which in this case is AWS. It also creates an Amazon VPC called `demo-vpc` with a `cidr_block` and a tag called `demo-vpc` defined.

### Initialize Terraform

To initialize Terraform, run the following command in the working directory:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
terraform init
~~~

Initialization plays a crucial role in Terraform, as it sets up essential components and configurations like provider plugins and backend settings. This ensures seamless and consistent execution of Terraform operations.

You should get the following output, which signifies that Terraform was successfully initialized in the directory with the `main.tf` file:

~~~{ caption="Output"}
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v4.67.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v4.67.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the 
provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version 
control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same 
selections by default when you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" 
to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All 
Terraform commands should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, 
other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
~~~

### Run the `terraform plan` Command

The [`terraform plan` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/plan) gives you a preview of the actions Terraform will take to create, delete, or modify your infrastructure. You can also save a plan (*ie* save the actions that Terraform will have to complete) and then apply it later.

To run the command, run `terraform plan` within the project directory (*ie* the `terraform-vpc-demo` directory):

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
terraform plan
~~~

Your output looks like this:

~~~{ caption="Output"}
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following 
execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_vpc.demo-vpc will be created
  + resource "aws_vpc" "demo-vpc" {
      + arn                                  = (known after apply)
      + cidr_block                           = "10.0.0.0/16"
      + default_network_acl_id               = (known after apply)
      + default_route_table_id               = (known after apply)
      + default_security_group_id            = (known after apply)
      + dhcp_options_id                      = (known after apply)
      + enable_classiclink                   = (known after apply)
      + enable_classiclink_dns_support       = (known after apply)
      + enable_dns_hostnames                 = (known after apply)
      + enable_dns_support                   = true
      + enable_network_address_usage_metrics = (known after apply)
      + id                                   = (known after apply)
      + instance_tenancy                     = "default"
      + ipv6_association_id                  = (known after apply)
      + ipv6_cidr_block                      = (known after apply)
      + ipv6_cidr_block_network_border_group = (known after apply)
      + main_route_table_id                  = (known after apply)
      + owner_id                             = (known after apply)
      + tags                                 = {
          + "Name" = "demo-vpc"
        }
      + tags_all                             = {
          + "Name" = "demo-vpc"
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't 
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.

~~~

The plan specifies that one resource, the `vpc.demo-vpc`, will be created. It also specifies that resources will be created in the `eu-west-1` region and, currently.

Currently, you should have only the default VPC in the region:

<div class="wide">
![Current VPCs]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/usbmXQF.png)
</div>

### Apply the Changes

The `terraform plan` command only shows you what will change, you need to run `terraform apply` to actually apply the changes:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
terraform apply
~~~

This is what your output looks like:

~~~{ caption="Output"}
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution 
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_vpc.demo-vpc will be created
  + resource "aws_vpc" "demo-vpc" {
      + arn                                  = (known after apply)
      + cidr_block                           = "10.0.0.0/16"
      + default_network_acl_id               = (known after apply)
      + default_route_table_id               = (known after apply)
      + default_security_group_id            = (known after apply)
      + dhcp_options_id                      = (known after apply)
      + enable_classiclink                   = (known after apply)
      + enable_classiclink_dns_support       = (known after apply)
      + enable_dns_hostnames                 = (known after apply)
      + enable_dns_support                   = true
      + enable_network_address_usage_metrics = (known after apply)
      + id                                   = (known after apply)
      + instance_tenancy                     = "default"
      + ipv6_association_id                  = (known after apply)
      + ipv6_cidr_block                      = (known after apply)
      + ipv6_cidr_block_network_border_group = (known after apply)
      + main_route_table_id                  = (known after apply)
      + owner_id                             = (known after apply)
      + tags                                 = {
          + "Name" = "demo-vpc"
        }
      + tags_all                             = {
          + "Name" = "demo-vpc"
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value:

~~~

Enter `yes` to approve the changes so Terraform starts creating the VPC. If the creation is successful, you'll get the following output:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
Enter a value: yes

aws_vpc.demo-vpc: Creating...
aws_vpc.demo-vpc: Creation complete after 4s [id=vpc-02fab61ec18bf51db]
~~~

To check if the VPC was created successfully, log in to your AWS Console with the root user and in the AWS services search bar, type in VPC. On the results click on *VPC* to open the VPC Console.

<div class="wide">
![Select VPCs]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/8LD0Gdz.png)
</div>

On the VPC console, click on **VPC** and you should see the Demo VPC that was created:

<div class="wide">
![Demo VPC created]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/rN5b6xd.png)
</div>

If you do not see the VPC created, make sure you're in the right region (*ie* the region specified in your Terraform code) in the provider block.

Please note that the VPC is associated with an existing [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) option set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html) and has a [main route table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html) and a [main network access control list (ACL)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html) that you did not specify in the Terraform code.

If you select the VPC you created and scroll down, you'll see that it doesn't have any subnets:

<div class="wide">
![No subnets for the VPC]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/UjoXhKh.png)
</div>

### Create Subnets

Subnets are created in an AWS VPC to segment the VPC's IP address range into smaller, more manageable blocks, providing isolation and fault tolerance. Subnets also allow you to distribute resources across different availability zones, enhancing the high availability of your applications and services in the cloud.

To create subnets in the VPC `demo-vpc`, add the following configurations to the `main.tf` file:

~~~{.tf caption="main.tf"}
resource "aws_subnet" "private-subnet-1" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.demo-vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "eu-west-1a"
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-1"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "private-subnet-2" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.demo-vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.2.0/24"
  availability_zone = "eu-west-1b"
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-2"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public-subnet-1" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.demo-vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.3.0/24"
  availability_zone = "eu-west-1a"
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet-1"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public-subnet-2" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.demo-vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.4.0/24"
  availability_zone = "eu-west-1b"
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet-2"
  }
}

~~~

This creates four subnets: two private subnets and two public subnets, one for each of the availability zones, `eu-west-1a` and `eu-west-1b`. Private and public subnets are necessary in an AWS VPC to separate resources with different levels of internet accessibility. Public subnets allow resources to have direct internet access, while private subnets restrict internet access, providing an additional layer of security for sensitive or internal resources.

The line `vpc_id = aws_vpc.demo-vpc.id` specifies that the newly created subnet, named `public-subnet-2`, will be associated with the VPC identified by the resource `demo-vpc` from the AWS provider. The `.id` at the end retrieves the unique identifier (*ie* ID) of the VPC resource to establish an association between the subnet and the corresponding VPC in the same AWS region.

Then run the plan command, and if all goes well, apply the changes:

<div class="wide">
![Subnets created]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/jaVQ9hT.png)
</div>

### Create an Internet Gateway

To provide internet access to the public subnets, you need to create an internet gateway. Add the following configuration to create an internet gateway called `demo-igw` in the `main.tf` file:

~~~{.tf caption="main.tf"}
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "demo-igw" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.demo-vpc.id
  tags = {
    Name = "demo-vpc-IGW"
    }
}
~~~

Specifying the VPC ID associates this internet gateway with the `demo-vpc` VPC. Currently, you only have the default internet gateway:

<div class="wide">
![Default internet gateway]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/cKNbpJe.png)
</div>

> *Please note:* It's not advisable to use the default gateway as you would need to modify resources which is introduced later in the article.

Once you apply the changes with `terraform apply`, you'll see that the `demo-vpc-IGW` internet gateway has been created:

<div class="wide">
![`demo-vpc-IGW` internet gateway created]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/aViZ0wt.png)
</div>

### Create a Third Route Table and Associate Public Subnets

You currently will have one or two route tables depending on whether you have done prior work in the AWS region:

<div class="wide">
![Current route tables]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/AUvw6AJ.png)
</div>

> **Please note:** The route table with the VPC ID: vpc-f96c5d9f existed in the AWS environment prior to this tutorial.

In this case, you need to create a third route table and associate the public subnets with this table so that the public subnets can be publicly accessible over the internet.

To do so, add the following configuration in the `main.tf` file:

~~~{.tf caption="main.tf"}
resource "aws_route_table" "public-route-table" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.demo-vpc.id
  tags = {
    Name = "public-route-table"
  }
}
~~~

Then apply the changes to create a public route table called `public-route-table`:

<div class="wide">
![Public route table created]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/w9qbUdP.png)
</div>

After applying the changes, you need to associate the public subnets with it. Currently, all the subnets are implicitly associated with the main route table:

<div class="wide">
![Implicit association with main route table]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/dYdLkRU.png)
</div>

To associate the public subnets with the `public-route-table`, add the following configuration to the `main.tf` file:

~~~{.tf caption="main.tf"}
resource "aws_route" "public-route" {
  route_table_id         = aws_route_table.public-route-table.id
  destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  gateway_id             = aws_internet_gateway.demo-igw.id
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "public-subnet-1-association" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public-subnet-1.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public-route-table.id
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "public-subnet-2-association" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public-subnet-2.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public-route-table.id
}
~~~

Then apply the changes, and the public subnets are now fully public:

<div class="wide">
![Public subnets associated with public route table]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/4lpNvTu.png)
</div>

### Create a NAT Gateway

To enable connectivity in the private subnets, you need to create a [NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) and associate it with the private subnets. Then you need to attach the NAT Gateway to an Elastic IP Address (EIP).

In AWS, an EIP is essential for obtaining a static and public IP address that remains associated with your AWS account. This EIP serves as a consistent endpoint for various resources such as EC2 instances, NAT gateways, or load balancers. Even if these resources are stopped or restarted, the EIP ensures there are no IP address changes or service interruptions, allowing for uninterrupted access to your resources.

Currently, there is no EIP address:

<div class="wide">
![No Elastic IP addresses]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Pp6ysKJ.png)
</div>

And there is no NAT gateway:

<div class="wide">
![No NAT gateway]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/aGtzxGv.png)
</div>

To create the NAT gateway, add the following configuration in the `main.tf` file:

~~~{.tf caption="main.tf"}
resource "aws_eip" "nat-eip" {
  vpc = true
   tags = {
      Name = "nat-eip"
      }
}

resource "aws_nat_gateway" "nat-gateway" {
  allocation_id = aws_eip.nat-eip.id
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public-subnet-1.id
  tags = {
      Name = "nat-gateway"
      }
}
~~~

This configuration creates an Elastic IP address that is used to create the NAT gateway (*ie* `nat-gateway`). Apply the configuration, and you should see that the Elastic IP address and NAT gateway were created:

<div class="wide">
![Elastic IP created]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/cYAJmgP.png)
</div>

<div class="wide">
![NAT gateway created]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/Mdwu5Et.png)
</div>

### Configure Security Groups

Once you've created the NAT gateway, it's time to create security groups that act as virtual firewalls. Security groups control inbound and outbound traffic based on defined rules. By creating security groups, you can precisely manage network access to your instances, allowing you to specify which protocols, ports, and IP addresses are permitted, ultimately enhancing the security posture of your cloud infrastructure.

We are going to create two security groups, `web-sg` and `db-sg`:

- **`web-sg`** is intended for web servers or instances that need to receive incoming HTTP traffic on port `80`. The [ingress rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules.html) allows incoming TCP traffic on port `80` from any source IP address (*ie* `0.0.0.0/0`). The egress rule allows all outbound traffic to any destination IP address (*ie* `0.0.0.0/0`).
- **`db-sg`** is intended for database servers or instances that need to receive incoming traffic on port `3306` (typically used for MySQL database connections). The ingress rule allows incoming TCP traffic on port `3306` from the private subnets (in this case, `10.0.1.0/24` and `10.0.2.0/24` which are the IP address of the private subnets), allowing communication only from within the VPC. The egress rule allows all outbound traffic to any destination IP address (*ie* `0.0.0.0/0`).

To create the security groups, add the following configuration to the `main.tf` file:

~~~{.tf caption="main.tf"}
resource "aws_security_group" "web-sg" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.demo-vpc.id
  name   = "web-sg"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "web-sg"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "db-sg" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.demo-vpc.id
  name   = "db-sg"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 3306
    to_port     = 3306
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]  
    # Allow traffic from private subnets
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "db-sg"
  }
}
~~~

By configuring the security groups in this way, `web-sg` allows incoming HTTP traffic from anywhere, and `db-sg` only allows incoming database traffic from the specified private subnets. This helps to ensure the appropriate security and restricts access to services such as databases.

Once you apply the changes, `web-sg` and `db-sg` are created:

<div class="wide">
![`web-sg` and `db-sg` security groups created]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/dcsjqJA.png)
</div>

> **Please note:** The other three security groups existed in my AWS environment prior to this tutorial.

### Provision Your Resources

Now that you've finished building the VPC, move on to provisioning resources.

#### Provision Amazon EC2 Instances

Provisioning EC2 instances is necessary to create and manage virtual servers in the cloud within the AWS infrastructure. To create two EC2 instances, add the following configuration in the `resources.tf` file:

~~~{.tf caption="main.tf"}
resource "aws_instance" "private-instance" {
  ami           = "ami-00aa9d3df94c6c354"FF
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.private-subnet-1.id
  tags = {
    Name = "private-instance"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "public-instance" {
  ami           = "ami-09fd16644beea3565"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public-subnet-1.id
  tags = {
    Name = "public-instance"
  }
}
~~~

This configuration creates two EC2 instances: one in a private subnet called `private-instance` and the other in the public subnet called `public-instance`. These instances are provisioned using the Amazon Linux 2023 Amazon Machine Image (AMI) (*ie* `ami-00aa9d3df94c6c354`) and the Ubuntu Server 22.04 Long Term Support (LTS) (*ie* `ami-09fd16644beea3565`). Then they're associated with their respective subnets. This association is crucial as it ensures that public instances are placed in public subnets, while private instances are deployed to private subnets.

As a reminder, there are currently no instances in the environment:

<div class="wide">
![Currently no instances]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/zc65ph6.png)
</div>

You need to apply the configuration to add these two instances:

<div class="wide">
![Two new instances created]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/05t0QLb.png)
</div>

### Manage VPCs With Terraform

You've probably already realized that you can create Amazon VPCs with Terraform as well as manage them (*ie* change configurations), remove resources, and even destroy the VPC with all its elements. This enables you to version, review, and maintain your infrastructure configurations in a consistent and reproducible manner. By treating infrastructure as code, you can apply software engineering practices, such as version control, code review, and automated testing to your infrastructure changes.

#### Update the VPC Configuration and Modify Subnets

To update the VPC configuration, all you need to do is make changes to the configuration file specifying the update. To demonstrate, update the private subnet configuration by swapping the availability zones. In this case, `private-subnet-1` changes from the availability zone `eu-west-1a` to `eu-west-1b`, and `private-subnet-2` changes from `eu-west-1b` to `eu-west-1c`.

In the `main.tf` file, edit the following configuration:

~~~{.tf caption="main.tf"}
resource "aws_subnet" "private-subnet-1" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.demo-vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "eu-west-1a"
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-1"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "private-subnet-2" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.demo-vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.2.0/24"
  availability_zone = "eu-west-1b"
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-2"
  }
}
~~~

And update it with this:

~~~{.tf caption="main.tf"}
resource "aws_subnet" "private-subnet-1" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.demo-vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "eu-west-1b"
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-1"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "private-subnet-2" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.demo-vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.2.0/24"
  availability_zone = "eu-west-1a"
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-2"
  }
}
~~~

Apply the changes and the private subnets' availability zones are updated. This change also updates the `private-instance`.

<div class="wide">
![Private subnet availability zone updates]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/NcOPWMR.png)
</div>

#### Destroy the VPC

To destroy the VPC and its associated resources, you can use the `terraform destroy` command:

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
terraform destroy
~~~

When you run the command, you are prompted to review the resources that will be destroyed. Type **yes** to confirm.

Executing the `terraform destroy` command permanently deletes all the resources you created within the Terraform configuration. In this case, it deletes the VPC, subnets, EC2 instances, security groups, internet gateway, and NAT gateway. Make sure you have a backup strategy in place before executing this command.

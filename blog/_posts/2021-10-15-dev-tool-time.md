> As a developer advocate, Adam Gordon Bell writes prose as a central part of his work. As a programmer, he wants the same experience writing prose that he has writing code, where linters and build pipelines help with consistency, formatting, and error checking. When Adam joined us for Dev Tool Time on September 29, 2021, he shared his favorite dev tools for writing and how Earthly helps keep his published writing high quality.

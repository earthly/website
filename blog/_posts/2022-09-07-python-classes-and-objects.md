If you're a developer looking to level up your Python skills, adding OOP to your Python box can be helpful. This tutorial will help you get started with object-oriented programming in Python.

Python is [one of the most-loved programming languages](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) that supports procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms.

Procedural programming works fine for simple and smaller projects. But as you start working on larger applications, it's important to organize code better. Object-oriented programming lets you group related data and functions logically. It also facilitates code reuse and lets you add functionality on top of existing code.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Create and work with classes and objects in Python
- Define instance attributes and methods
- Define class variables and methods
- Use class methods as constructors
- Define static methods

## How to Create Classes and Objects in Python

Python natively supports object-oriented programming and all variables that you create are objects.
You can start a Python REPL and run the following line of code: it calls the `type()` function with `py_num` as the argument. The output reads `<class 'int'>` which means `py_num` is an object of the integer class.

~~~{.python caption=">_"}
>>> py_num = 8
>>> type(py_num)
<class 'int'>
~~~

You can verify this for a few more built-in data types.

~~~{.python caption=">_"}
>>> py_str = "A Python String"
>>> type(py_str)
<class 'str'>
>>> py_list = [2,4,9]
>>> type(py_list)
<class 'list'>
~~~

Like all modern programming languages, Python lets you create custom classes. A **class** is a template or a blueprint from which you can create **objects** of the class, also called **instances**.

To create a class, you can use the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class: `class ClassName`. By convention, the class names are specified in Pascal case—where the first letter of each word in a variable name is capitalized.

In this tutorial, let's consider the example of `Student` class—containing student records for a given academic year.

[You may download the code and follow along](https://github.com/balapriyac/Python-OOP/blob/main/main.py).

 All of the code below is in the `main.py` file.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
class Student:
    pass # placeholder for code that we'll write shortly!
~~~

After you've created a class, you can create an object by calling the class as if it were a function.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
student_1 = Student()
~~~

To verify if the created object is an instance of a particular class, you can use one of the following methods:

- Call the `type()` function with the object name as the argument.

- Call the `isinstance()` function. `isinstance(<object_name>,<ClassName>)` returns `True` if `<object_name>` is an instance of the class `<ClassName>`; else it returns `False`.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
print(type(student_1))
print(isinstance(student_1,Student))
~~~

~~~{ .merge-code caption="Output"}
# Output
<class '__main__.Student'>
True
~~~

## Understanding Instance Attributes and Methods

The data associated with the objects or instances are called **attributes**. The actions that the objects can perform or allow us to perform on them are called **methods**.

After you've created an instance, you may define attributes using `<object_name>.<attribute_name> = <value>`.

However, this doesn't facilitate code reuse and there's no advantage of using a class. You'll want to programmatically initialize these attributes with their respective values—whenever you instantiate an object. To do this, you can use the `__init__` method which serves as the class constructor.

### How the `__init__` Method Works

The `__init__` method is the class constructor that helps _initialize_ the attributes of instances. All methods defined inside the class are indented by four spaces.

Whenever a method is defined inside a class, it takes the instance of the class as the first argument and is usually named `self`.

<div class="notice--info">
The usage of `self` as the first parameter is a recommended practice according to the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-method-arguments) and is not a strict requirement.
</div>

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
class Student:
    def __init__(self,first_name,last_name,tuition):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.tuition = tuition
~~~

Whenever you create an instance of the class `Student`, the `__init__` method does the following:

- It automatically  takes in the instance as the first argument (denoted by `self`). In this example, instance denotes a particular student object.
- It assigns the values of the parameters, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `tuition` to the instance attributes `first_name`, `last_name`, and `tuition` of the specific instance.

To improve readability, you can consider giving the same names to both the attributes and the parameters in the `__init__` constructor, but different names, as shown in the code snippet below, would work just fine.

~~~{.python caption=""}
class Student:
    def __init__(self,fname,lname,tuition_amt):
        self.first_name = fname
        self.last_name = lname
        self.tuition = tuition_amt
~~~

Summing up what we've learned so far: The `Student` class serves as a template—with attributes `first_name`, `last_name`, and `tuition`—from which we can create student objects each having their own first and last names, and an associated tuition.

As the above attributes are unique to a specific object, they are referred to as **instance attributes** or **instance variables**.

<div class="wide">

![create-objects-from-class]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/wcXVeEw.png)\

</div>

Now that you've defined the `__init__` method, you can instantiate objects with the desired values for instance attributes, as shown below.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
student_1 = Student('Jane','Smith',20000)
student_2 = Student('John','Doe',15000)
~~~

### How to Define and Call Instance Methods

In addition to the `__init__` method, you can define other methods that act on the instances of the class, often accessing and modifying the instance attributes. Such methods are rightly named **instance methods**.

Let's revisit the `Student` class example.

Given the attributes `first_name` and `last_name`, we can define methods that use these attributes and return the full name and email for each student object. We name these methods `get_full_name()` and `get_email()`, respectively . Remember, all instance methods take the instance (`self`) as the first argument.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
class Student:
    def __init__(self,first_name,last_name,tuition):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.tuition = tuition

    def get_full_name(self):
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"

    def get_email(self):
        return f"{self.first_name}.{self.last_name}@school.edu"
~~~

To call an instance method you can use, `<instance_name>.<method()>`. You can also call an instance method using the class with the syntax: `<ClassName>.<method>(<instance_name>)`. Though verbose, this method helps understand how the instance is passed in as the first argument.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# calling instance method on the instance
print(student_1.get_email())
# calling instance method using the class
print(Student.get_email(student_2))
~~~

~~~{ .merge-code caption="Output"}
# Output
Jane.Smith@school.edu
John.Doe@school.edu
~~~

## What Are Class Variables and How to Use Them?

So far, you've learned how to define instance variables, specific to an instance or object of the class, and instance methods that operate on the instance variables.

However, there are times when you'll need certain attributes that remain the _same_ for _all instances_ of a particular class. You can define such attributes as **class variables**.

Typically, class variables are defined before other instance and class methods that'll use them.

### Initializing and Accessing Class Variables

For example, in the `Student` class, if you're maintaining the student records for a given academic year, then there can be a class variable, `academic_year` that will remain the same for all student objects created from the `Student` class.

We can define another class variable, `num_students` that keeps track of the number of student objects created. Every time you create a new student object, the value of `num_students` is incremented by 1.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
class Student:
    academic_yr = '2022-23'
    num_students = 0

    def __init__(self,first_name,last_name,tuition):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.tuition = tuition
        Student.num_students +=1

    def get_full_name(self):
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"

    def get_email(self):
        return f"{self.first_name}.{self.last_name}@school.edu"
~~~

You can access class variables using the syntax: `ClassName.var_name`.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
student_1 = Student('Jane','Smith',20000)
student_2 = Student('John','Doe',15000)
print(Student.academic_yr)
print(Student.num_students)
~~~

We've created two student objects, hence the value of the class variable `num_students` is now 2.

~~~{ caption="Output"}
# Output
2022-23
2
~~~

## How to Use Class Methods in Python

In addition to class variables, you can also define **class methods** that bind to a class. Such methods do not access any of the instance attributes but can be used to set the value of a class variable or function as an alternative **class constructor**.

Suppose the university sets the value of `fee_waiver`, a number between zero and one—indicating the fraction of the tuition to be waived. Instead of hardcoding it as a class variable, you can define a method that sets the value of  `fee_waiver`.

To convert an instance method to a class method, you can use the `@classmethod` decorator in Python. By convention, the first argument in class methods is `cls`, just the way the first argument in instance methods is `self`.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
    @classmethod
    def set_fee_waiver(cls,fee_waiver):
        cls.fee_waiver = fee_waiver
~~~

Now that you've defined the class method, you can define an instance method `apply_fee_waiver()` that applies the fee waiver and returns the updated `tuition` for any student object.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
    def apply_fee_waiver(self):
        self.tuition -= self.tuition*Student.fee_waiver
        return self.tuition
~~~

Let's set the `fee_waiver` and apply the fee waiver for `student_1`.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
Student.set_fee_waiver(0.1)
print(student_1.apply_fee_waiver())
~~~

~~~{ .merge-code caption="Output"}
# Output
# 0.1*tuition has been waived
18000.0
~~~

<div class="notice--info">

### Decorators in Python: An Overview

Let's start with an example.

~~~{.python caption=""}
def add(x,y):
  return x + y
~~~

Here, `add()` is a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

Say, we would like to modify this function by doubling each of the arguments before addition. We could change the return statement to read:  `return 2*x + 2*y` but what if you no longer wanted to double the arguments? In that case, you'll have to modify the function definition yet again. **Enter decorators.**

In Python, a **decorator** is a function that extends the functionality of existing functions without modifying them explicitly. As explained earlier, all variables in Python are inherently objects, so are functions. Therefore, you can pass in functions as arguments to another function and you can define a function that returns another function.

Read through the code snippet below.

~~~{.python caption=""}
def double_xy(f):
  def wrapper(x,y):
    return f(2*x,2*y)
  return wrapper
~~~

Let's parse the definition of `double_xy()`.

- The function `double_xy()` accepts a function `f` as the argument.
- In the body of the function, we define a `wrapper()` function that is parameterized by `x` and `y`.
- The `wrapper()` returns the function `f`, called with `2*x` and `2*y` as the arguments.
- The function `double_xy()` returns the inner `wrapper()` function.

Next, you can call the function `double_xy()` with `add` as the argument and assign it (again) to `add`—just the way you'd call a function and assign its return value to a variable.

When you now call `add()` with values for `x` and `y`, it returns the sum of `2*x` and `2*y`.

~~~{.python caption=""}
add = double_xy(add)
add(1,2) #6  
~~~

Instead of the above verbose syntax, you have a succinct syntax. Just add `@double_xy` above the definition of the `add()` function, as shown below.

~~~{.python caption=""}
@double_xy
def add(x,y):
  return x + y

add(1,2) #6
~~~

Therefore, the function `double_xy()` _decorates_ the `add()` function to have the property of doubling the arguments and computing their sum.
</div>

At this point, we have the following code in the `main.py` file.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
class Student:
   #class variables
    academic_yr = '2022-23'
    num_students = 0

    def __init__(self,first_name,last_name,tuition):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.tuition = tuition
        Student.num_students +=1

    def get_full_name(self):
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"

    def get_email(self):
        return f"{self.first_name}.{self.last_name}@school.edu"
    
    @classmethod
    def set_fee_waiver(cls,fee_waiver):
        cls.fee_waiver = fee_waiver
    
    def apply_fee_waiver(self):
        self.tuition -= self.tuition*Student.fee_waiver
        return self.tuition   
~~~

Next, let's proceed to learn how to define class methods that can be used as constructors.

### How to Use Class Methods as Constructors

Suppose instead that the student data are available in the form of tuples - one tuple for each student. In this case, you should unpack the tuple into three variables, and then proceed to instantiate the object.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
student_tuple = ('Jane','Smith',20000)
first_name,last_name,tuition = ('Jane','Smith',20000)
student_1 = Student(first_name,last_name,tuition)
~~~

When you need to instantiate many objects, you'll have to repeat the unpacking step for each of the tuples—which is repetitive and suboptimal.

You can define a class method `from_tuple()` that unpacks the tuple and assigns the values to the attribute names. You can then return a reference to the class, which allows us to instantiate objects by calling the class method.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
    @classmethod
    def from_tuple(cls,student_tuple):
        first_name, last_name, tuition = student_tuple
        return cls(first_name,last_name,tuition)
~~~

Now, you can create student objects from the tuples using the `from_tuple()` method as the constructor.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
student_tuple_1 = ('Jane','Smith',20000)
student_1 = Student.from_tuple(student_tuple_1)
student_tuple_2 = ('John','Doe',25000)
student_2 = Student.from_tuple(student_tuple_2)
~~~

You can define variants of the above class constructors to construct objects by parsing Python strings, [JSON](/blog/convert-to-from-json) files, and more.

## How to Use Static Methods in Python

Suppose you'd like to define a method that is _related_ to the class; but you don't need to access any of the class and instance variables inside it. In this case, you should consider defining it as a **static method**.

For example, in the `Student` class, you can define a method `is_fall()` that takes in a date and checks whether or not the ongoing semester is the fall semester.

To work with dates, let's import the `date` class from Python's built-in `datetime` module.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
from datetime import date
~~~

To define a static method, you can use the `@staticmethod` decorator. Assuming that the months September, October, and November correspond to fall, we check if the month attribute of the date—passed in as the argument to `is_fall()`—is in the list [9,10,11].

Let's add the following definition of  `is_fall()` to the class.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
    @staticmethod
    def is_fall(date):
        if date.month in [9,10,11]:
            print("Yes, the fall semester is in progress.")
        else:
            print("Not the fall semester")
~~~

Even though a static method is not bound to the class or an instance of the class, it's still present in the namespace of the `Student` class. You can call the static method just the way you'd call any class method in scope with the syntax: `ClassName.static_method()`. Let's call `is_fall()` with today's date as the argument, and it's not fall yet in 2022.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
today = date.today()
Student.is_fall(today)
~~~

~~~{ .merge-code caption="Output"}
# Output: 
Not the fall semester
~~~

Putting it all together, we have the following code in the `main.py` file.

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
from datetime import date

class Student:
    academic_yr = '2022-23'
    num_students = 0

    def __init__(self,first_name,last_name,tuition):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.tuition = tuition
        Student.num_students +=1

    def get_full_name(self):
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"

    def get_email(self):
        return f"{self.first_name}.{self.last_name}@school.edu"
    
    @classmethod
    def set_fee_waiver(cls,fee_waiver):
        cls.fee_waiver = fee_waiver
    
    def apply_fee_waiver(self):
        self.tuition -= self.tuition*Student.fee_waiver
        return self.tuition  
 
    # class method as constructor
    @classmethod
    def from_tuple(cls,student_tuple):
        first_name, last_name, tuition = student_tuple
        return cls(first_name,last_name,tuition)

    @staticmethod
    def is_fall(date):
        if date.month in [9,10,11]:
            print("Yes, the fall semester is in progress.")
        else:
            print("Not the fall semester")

~~~

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we delved deep into how classes and objects work within the Python programming language. We created classes that serve as templates to create objects that have their own set of data (instance attributes) and functions (instance methods).

We then learned how to use class variables for attributes that take the _same_ value across all instances of a particular class and how class methods can be used as alternative class constructors. We also covered the use of static methods to define related functions that are associated neither with the class nor a particular instance.

In the next tutorial in the series, we'll go over how we can leverage and extend the functionality of existing classes using inheritance in Python.
